abstract:
- content: This report documents collection methods for high signal-to-noise ratio
    (SNR) in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) radio frequency (RF) recordings of long-term
    evolution (LTE) uplink emissions from a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) handset
    in a fully conducted environment. A base station emulator was used to configure
    the handset to statically transmit over various LTE physical resource block configuration
    for 1.4 MHz, 3 MHz, 5 MHz, and 10 MHz uplink channels centered at 1770 MHz in
    LTE Band 66, which is a frequency-division duplex (FDD) band. The aim of this
    effort was to acquire a dataset that could be used to aid the development of computational
    models for emissions from real-world communication hardware.
