abstract:
- content: Data classification is the process an organization uses to characterize
    its data assets using persistent labels so those assets can be managed properly.
    Data classification is vital for protecting an organization’s data at scale because
    it enables application of cybersecurity and privacy protection requirements to
    the organization’s data assets. This publication defines basic terminology and
    explains fundamental concepts in data classification so there is a common language
    for all to use. It can also help organizations improve the quality and efficiency
    of their data protection approaches by becoming more aware of data classification
    considerations and taking them into account in business and mission use cases,
    such as secure data sharing, compliance reporting and monitoring, zero-trust architecture,
    and large language models.
