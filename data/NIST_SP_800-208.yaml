abstract:
- content: 'This recommendation specifies two algorithms that can be used to generate
    a digital signature, both of which are stateful hash-based signature schemes:
    the Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) system and the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme
    (XMSS), along with their multi-tree variants, the Hierarchical Signature System
    (HSS) and multi-tree XMSS (XMSSMT).'
