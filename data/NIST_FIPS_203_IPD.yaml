abstract:
- content: A key-encapsulation mechanism (or KEM) is a set of algorithms that, under
    certain conditions, can be used by two parties to establish a shared secret key
    over a public channel. A shared secret key that is securely established using
    a KEM can then be used with symmetric-key cryptographic algorithms to perform
    basic tasks in secure communications, such as encryption and authentication. This
    standard specifes a key-encapsulation mechanism called ML-KEM. The security of
    ML-KEM is related to the computational diffculty of the so-called Module Learning
    with Errors problem. At present, ML-KEM is believed to be secure even against
    adversaries who possess a quantum computer. This standard specifes three parameter
    sets for ML-KEM. In order of increasing security strength (and decreasing performance),
    these parameter sets are ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024.
