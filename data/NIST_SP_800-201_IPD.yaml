abstract:
- content: This document summarizes research performed by the members of the NIST
    Cloud Computing Forensic Science Working Group and presents the NIST Cloud Computing
    Forensic Reference Architecture (CC FRA, also referred to as FRA for the sake
    of brevity), whose goal is to provide support for a cloud system’s forensic readiness.
    The CC FRA is meant to help users understand which cloud forensic challenges might
    exist for an organization’s cloud system. It identifies challenges that require
    at least partial mitigation strategies and how a forensic investigator would apply
    that to a particular forensic investigation. The CC FRA presented here is both
    a methodology and an initial implementation. Users are encouraged to customize
    this initial implementation for their specific situations and needs.
