abstract:
- content: "At COP 21 (Paris), there was general agreement that programs to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate atmospheric warming will require an understanding
    of existing emissions as well as programs to monitor, report, and verify emissions
    from a broad range of sources. Because ~70% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
    originate from urban environments, where a majority of the world’s population
    lives, an increased emphasis on monitoring efforts was needed for them. NIST has
    responded to these measurements and standards challenge as the U.S. Metrology
    Institute to: a)\timprove U.S. capabilities to measure GHG emissions accurately;
    b)\tdemonstrate the capabilities of atmospheric urban monitoring networks (top-down
    or atmospheric measurement approaches) to determine quantitatively GHG fluxes
    from industrial, residential, transportation, power generation and other activities;
    c)\tcomplement such measurements with spatially explicit emissions modeling (bottom-up
    or emissions modeling) approaches based on socio-economic data; andd)\tdemonstrate
    that the combination improves confidence in emission estimates while identifying
    areas of improvement.NIST programs were established to improve measurements of
    carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrous oxide, isotopic components of
    CO2 and oxygen, aerosols, and GHG smokestack emissions. New remote sensing methods
    were developed applying technologies over large areas and NIST’s gas standards
    program was expanded to close with NOAA, WMO’s GHG Central Calibration Laboratory
    to ensure data accuracy and consistency via SI traceability and to strengthen
    mutual recognition of atmospheric GHG emission measurements. Computational tools
    were advanced collaboratively with other institutions to model spatially explicit
    emission sources, biogenic emission and uptake processes, and enable urban GHG
    source attribution from atmospheric measurements.NIST established its first Urban
    Test Bed in Indianapolis, Indiana (the INFLUX Project) in 2010 with Purdue University,
    NOAA, and Penn State University collaborators. Additional testbeds were established
    Los Angeles (2012) and the Northeast Corridor (2014) to test applicability of
    methodologies over a range of meteorological conditions and emissions profiles.
    For INFLUX, results over a 3-year analysis period (2012-2015) demonstrated <3%
    agreement between top-down and emissions modeling. Testing of the combined approach,
    bottom-up emissions were offset by +15% with a top-down method correcting this
    by -14.2%. This performance show sensitivity levels sufficient to track mitigation
    actions on a yearly basis. (Yearly reduction targets of 1% to 3% are seen across
    the globe.) More than 200 archival publications have resulted and been cited >10,000
    times and fostering successful engagement of an outstanding team of U.S. researchers
    addressing this global challenge.Workshops were organized collaboratively in China
    and Europe bringing together the metrology and meteorology communities to address
    this challenge of common interest. The formation of the Integrated Global Greenhouse
    Gas Information System (IG3IS) at WMO was catalyzed and are expected initiate
    international documentary standards on GHG measurements. NIST contributed to the
    development of a National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S. Greenhouse Gas
    Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System. NIST efforts to quantify GHG
    emissions are also critical for implementation of the proposed guidance issued
    by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding listing of Voluntary
    Carbon Credit Derivative Contracts in the Voluntary Carbon Market. NIST has contributed
    substantially to addressing the emissions quantification challenges posed by the
    Earth’s warming atmosphere and measures aimed at the primary agent driving that
    warming, greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere."
