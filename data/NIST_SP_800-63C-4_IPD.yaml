abstract:
- content: These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing
    digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or
    use of standards outside of this purpose. This guideline focuses on the use of
    federated identity and the use of assertions to implement identity federations.
    Federation allows a given credential service provider to provide authentication
    attributes and (optionally) subscriber attributes to a number of separately-administered
    relying parties. Similarly, relying parties may use more than one credential service
    provider. This publication will supersede NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63C.
