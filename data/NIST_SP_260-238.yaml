    Material® (SRM®) 3666 Albumin and Creatinine in Frozen Human Urine (Level 1 to
    Level 4) delivers certified values for albumin and creatinine in human urine.
    The material is intended for 1) use in validating measurement procedures and 2)
    use in qualifying control materials produced in-house and analyzed using measurement
    methods for the determination of albumin, creatinine, or the albumin-to-creatinine
    ratio (ACR) in human urine. A unit of SRM 3666 consists of four (4) vials of frozen
    pooled human urine with endogenous levels of albumin determined using the NIST
    candidate reference measurement procedure (RMP) for albumin in urine [1]; and
    creatinine determined using the NIST RMP for creatinine in serum [2]. The certified
    values and associated uncertainties for albumin and creatinine were used to calculate
    the ACR for each level (Level 1 to Level 4). This publication documents the production,
    measurement processes, results, and statistical evaluations involved in the production
    and certification of SRM 3666.
