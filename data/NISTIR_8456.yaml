abstract:
- content: The pixel is often used as a unit of measurement in information technology.
    Unfortunately, there is not a simple, consistently-applicable answer to what it
    is a measure of. This report analyzes the pixel unit through the lens of metrology
    and shows how one entity, the pixel, actually gives rise to a group of different
    units.
