abstract:
- content: This document describes an approach that NIST would use and other parties
    could use for mapping the elements of documentary standards, regulations, frameworks,
    and guidelines to NIST publications, such as CSF Subcategories or SP 800-53r5
    controls. NIST intends for this approach to be used for future mappings involving
    NIST cybersecurity and privacy publications that will be submitted via the NIST
    National Online Informative References (OLIR) process for hosting on NISTâ€™s online
    Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool (CPRT). By following this approach, NIST
    and others in the cybersecurity and privacy standards community can jointly establish
    a single concept system over time that links cybersecurity and privacy concepts
    from many sources into a cohesive, consistent set of relationship mappings within
    the NIST CPRT. The approach is informed by concept system and terminology standards,
    as well as experience with what information the cybersecurity and privacy community
    would find most valuable.
