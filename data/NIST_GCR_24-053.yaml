abstract:
- content: A novel wireless sensor network is developed and demonstrated for monitoring
    indoor fixturelevel water use in buildings. The new technology consists of a low-cost,
    battery-powered,miniature wireless sensor module for non-invasive detection of
    flow through pipes. Whendeployed in a typical commercial, industrial, or residential
    building, the modules form a remotewireless sensor network that accurately monitors
    the incidence and patterns of water usage atindividual fixtures. As proof of concept,
    the wireless sensor network was deployed and tested ina dormitory at the University
    of Cincinnati (UC) where several water fixtures were monitored ata 1-second interval
    for a period of five months. The water use data were analyzed to obtainpeak period
    probabilities of fixture use (i.e., p-values). Fixture p-values are needed to
    estimatethe instantaneous peak water demand in buildings, the key parameter for
    properly sizingpremise plumbing systems. A dimensionless ramp function on the
    unit square is developed anddemonstrated as a versatile approach to help engineers
    obtain reasonable estimates of fixturep-values in new buildings where water use
    data may be lacking or sparse. A protocol issuggested to guide investigators on
    how to compile, consolidate, and archive high resolutionwater use data into a
    cloud-based repository. Results include preliminary estimates of p-valuesfor restroom
    fixtures in a large sports arena on the UC campus. Peak flows at the sport arenameasured
    during five NCAA basketball game days are compared against predicted peak flowsfrom
    the Water Demand Calculator. Finally, peak flow measurements at 20 large contemporaryresidential
    buildings across the US are compared against predictions of the 99th percentile
    fromthe Water Demand Calculator.
