abstract:
- content: FIPS 201 defines the requirements and characteristics of government-wide
    interoperable identity credentials used by federal employees and contractors.
    It also calls for the federated use of those credentials. These guidelines provide
    technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services
    for federal employees and contractors and are not intended to constrain the development
    or use of standards outside of this purpose. This document focuses on the use
    of federated PIV identity and the use of assertions to implement PIV federations
    backed by PIV identity accounts and PIV credentials. Federation allows a PIV identity
    account to be used by relying parties outside the PIV identity account's home
    agency.
