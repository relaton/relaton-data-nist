abstract:
- content: This publication provides a basis for establishing a discipline for systems
    security engineering (SSE) as part of systems engineering and does so in terms
    of its principles, concepts, activities, and tasks. The publication also demonstrates
    how those SSE principles, concepts, activities, and tasks can be effectively applied
    to systems engineering efforts to foster a common mindset to deliver security
    for any system, regardless of its purpose, type, scope, size, complexity, or stage
    of its system life cycle. Ultimately, the intent of the material is to advance
    the field of SSE as a discipline that can be applied and studied and to serve
    as a basis for the development of educational and training programs, including
    the development of professional certifications and other assessment criteria.
