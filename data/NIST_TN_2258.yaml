abstract:
- content: Mobile manipulators, which integrate a robotic manipulator with an automatic-autonomous
    mobile base, have the potential to augment automation by combining the capability
    of navigation with complex manipulation to support unstructured and dynamic environments.
    Targeted applications include manufacturing large-scale parts commonly encountered
    in the aerospace, energy, shipbuilding, and transportation sectors. While autonomous
    mobility no longer restricts the robotic manipulator to working at a single, rigidly
    fixtured workstation or work-piece, the increased flexibility introduces new sources
    of position and orientation uncertainty, and manufacturing processes of large-scale
    parts with complex, curved surfaces require high repeatability and accuracy. A
    standardized measurement methodology, including a configurable measurement artifact
    to simulate dynamic manufacturing operations, is being developed to identify and
    evaluate these sources of performance uncertainty. As part of this methodology
    and associated test methods development, this work details the design and prototype
    implementation of a closed-loop mobile manipulator control system that integrates
    feedback from an optical tracking system. Development of the control system presents
    a new test implementation to demonstrate the performance evaluation of mobile
    manipulation performance in application scenarios where the workstation or work-piece
    is physically disturbed during operation or where rapid registration between distant
    locations along the same work-piece is required. This work will promote advances
    in control scheme development by providing a standardized, reproducible test method
    for evaluation in a variety of simulated application spaces.
