abstract:
- content: Biofabricated tissue-engineered constructs have the potential to transform
    personalized medicine. However, characterizing these constructs post-fabrication
    and throughout preclinical use remains challenging. On December 1, 2022, the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) held a one-day, virtual workshop
    on measurement needs for biofabricated constructs that contain cells. The workshop
    focused on metrology for the structure of the constructs, cell viability in the
    constructs, and functional capacity of the constructs, with the aim of enabling
    future research directions, standards development, and the adoption of these constructs
    for clinical use.
