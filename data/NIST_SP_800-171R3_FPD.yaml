abstract:
- content: The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) resident in
    nonfederal systems and organizations is of paramount importance to federal agencies
    and can directly impact the ability of the Federal Government to successfully
    conduct its essential missions and functions. This publication provides federal
    agencies with recommended security requirements for protecting the confidentiality
    of CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal systems and organizations.
    The requirements apply to components of nonfederal systems that process, store,
    or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such components. The security requirements
    are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements
    established between those agencies and nonfederal organizations.
