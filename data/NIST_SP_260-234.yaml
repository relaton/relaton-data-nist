    (RMs) 8690 Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Aqueous Film-Forming
    Foams (AFFF) Formulation I, RM 8691 Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)
    in Aqueous Film-Forming Foams (AFFF) Formulation II, RM 8692 Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl
    Substances (PFAS) in Aqueous Film-Forming Foams (AFFF) Formulation III, and RM
    8693 Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Aqueous Film-Forming Foams
    (AFFF) Formulation IV deliver non-certified values of the identity and quantity
    of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in four formulations prepared from
    commercial aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) products. These RMs are intended for
    use as quality control materials for PFAS measurements; they are not meant for
    use in establishing the metrological traceability of measurement results to the
    International System of Units (SI). Each unit of these RMs consists of one ampoule
    containing approximately 1.2 mL of an AFFF solution diluted 10:1 (vol:vol) in
    methanol and modified by addition of PFAS analytical standards. This publication
    documents the production, analytical methods, and computations involved in characterizing
    these products.
