abstract:
- content: Two recreational vehicle (RV) travel trailers were burned outdoors at the
    Austin Fire Department training campus in Austin, TX. The goal of these preliminary
    experiments was to observe and document the burning behavior of fully furnished
    RV trailers and to assess the feasibility of future instrumented burns in the
    National Fire Research Laboratory. Burning parcel-level combustibles can produce
    significant thermal exposures to surrounding combustibles, often leading to fire
    spread beyond the object of origin. In wildland-urban interface (WUI) fires, this
    scenario often perpetuates fire spread leading to destruction further into a community.
    For these field burns, the RV trailers were ignited from the exterior, representing
    a WUI fire scenario where a parcel-level combustible ignites and becomes an exposure
    source, producing an enhanced fire spread pathway to other nearby combustibles
    or primary structures. The RV trailers were 6.7 m (22 ft) long and were equipped
    with basic factory-installed furnishings. Videos of the burns were recorded from
    multiple angles to document visual observations of fire behavior and flame lengths.
    The primary burning period of each trailer ranged from 13 min to 17 min. Maximum
    flame lengths were approximately 10 m (30 ft). Observations from the field burns
    present some concerns about the size of the fire for potential indoor laboratory
    study. The burns were conducted in collaboration with the Austin Fire Department,
    U.S. Fire Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. Consumer
    Product Safety Commission.
