abstract:
- content: 'During Fiscal Year 2022 (FY 2022) - from October 1, 2021, through September
    30, 2022 -the NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) Cybersecurity and Privacy
    Program successfully responded to numerous challenges and opportunities in security
    and privacy. This Annual Report highlights the FY 2022 research activities for
    the ITL Cybersecurity and Privacy Program, including: the ongoing participation
    and development of international standards; research and practical applications
    in several key priority areas (e.g., Post Quantum Cryptography, updating the NIST
    Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0) and some new CSF profiles); accomplishments
    in the area of improving software and supply chain cybersecurity; IoT cybersecurity
    guidelines work; National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) projects,
    and setting up a new comment site for NIST''s Risk Management Framework work.
    NIST also celebrated a 50th anniversary in cybersecurity and the NCCoE celebrated
    a 10-year anniversary since inception.'
