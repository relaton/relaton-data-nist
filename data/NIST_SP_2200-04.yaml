abstract:
- content: The NIST Office of Weights and Measures (OWM) presents its second issue
    of the 2023 NIST Annual Summary of U.S. Legal Metrology Activities report. This
    report includes a summary of changes made to NIST Handbook 44 (2023) Specifications,
    Tolerances and Other Technical Requirements for Commercial Weighing and Measuring
    Devices, NIST Handbook 130 (2023) Uniform Laws and Regulations in the Areas of
    Legal Metrology, and Fuel Quality, and NIST Handbook 133 (2023) Checking the Net
    Contents of Packaged Goods. The summary will provide an archival record of proposals
    and associated actions with the goal of assisting the weights and measures community
    in consistently interpreting and implementing NIST Handbooks 44, and 130. Each
    item in this report includes a NIST OWM technical analysis, background information,
    and a summary of any actions taken on proposed changes to these NIST Handbooks
    considered in 2023.
