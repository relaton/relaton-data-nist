abstract:
- content: This report considers threshold signature schemes interchangeable with
    respect to the verification mechanism of the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
    (EdDSA). Historically, EdDSA is known as a variant of Schnorr signatures, which
    are well-studied and suitable for efficient thresholdization, i.e., for being
    computed when the private signing key is secret-shared across multiple parties.
    In the threshold setting, signatures remain unforgeable even if up to some threshold
    number of the cosigners become compromised. The report analyzes the conventional
    (non-threshold) EdDSA specification from Draft FIPS 186-5, reviews important security
    properties, with an emphasis on strong unforgeability, and distinguishes various
    approaches for corresponding threshold schemes. Notably, while providing better
    security assurances, threshold signatures can be used as drop-in replacement for
    conventionally produced signatures, without changing legacy code for verification
    of authenticity. The report identifies various challenges and questions that would
    benefit from more attention, are of interest for future guidance and recommendations,
    and may be applicable beyond EdDSA.
