abstract:
- content: Unmanaged cybersecurity risks can wreak havoc on a community. This is no
    less true for the U.S. scientific research ecosystem, particularly members of
    the higher education research community, which can be characterized by its fundamentally
    open, collaborative culture and web of highly decentralized administrative and
    research environments. Securing the digital resources that contribute to a thriving
    higher education research enterprise requires consideration of the threats and
    vulnerabilities relevant to the community as well as unique mission contexts,
    cultures, and motivations. This resource is intended to enable institutions of
    higher education to identify, assess, manage, and reduce cybersecurity risks related
    to conducting research, as described in Section 10229 of the CHIPS and Science
    Act.
