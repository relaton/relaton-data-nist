abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently released
    SRM 1568c Rice Flour which has value assignments for over 30 analytes, including
    arsenic species. This material is intended to be used for the evaluation of methods
    for the determination of elements and arsenic species in this and similar matrices.
    The material was purchased from commercial vendors. Measurement results were obtained
    from NIST and interlaboratory comparison exercises. This document describes the
    material, sample preparations, results, and data analysis.
