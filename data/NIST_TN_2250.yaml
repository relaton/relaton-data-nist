abstract:
- content: 'The Weight of Evidence (WoE) is defined to be the logarithm of the Bayes
    factor (BF) with base 10, which is generally with single point hypothesis rather
    than diffuse hypothesis. They are used in applications such as forensic science,
    etc. To statistically estimate the standard error (SE) and the 95% confidence
    interval of BF and WoE, both parametric and nonparametric two-sample bootstrap
    algorithms are employed, respectively. Then, three challenging issues arise: 1.
    how to generate observed binomial variates; 2. how many variates are needed; 3.
    how to implement bootstrap algorithms. The observed binomial variates can be generated
    using either the stochastic function-call method (i.e., call rbinom in R Package)
    or the deterministic partition method via the expected binomial densities (i.e.,
    call dbinom in R Package). To ensure the computational accuracies, the total number
    of observed binomial variates is determined by the root-mean-square deviation
    between the observed and expected binomial distributions, as well as the bootstrap
    variability caused by sampling. Thereafter, the parametric two-sample bootstrap
    algorithm is implemented on observed binomial variates generated using the stochastic
    function-call method, whereas the nonparametric two-sample bootstrap algorithm
    is carried out on observed binomial variates created using the deterministic partition
    method. In this article, a case study is carried out.'
