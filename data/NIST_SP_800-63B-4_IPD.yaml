abstract:
- content: These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing
    digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or
    use of standards outside of this purpose. These guidelines focus on the authentication
    of subjects interacting with government information systems over networks, establishing
    that a given claimant is a subscriber who has been previously authenticated. The
    result of the authentication process may be used locally by the system performing
    the authentication or may be asserted elsewhere in a federated identity system.
    This document defines technical requirements for each of the three authenticator
    assurance levels. This publication will supersede NIST Special Publication (SP)
    800-63B
