abstract:
- content: Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an application of neural networks that allows
    one to create an image that has the content of one image and the style of another
    image. For example, NST can be used to create an image of a cat in the style of
    Van Gogh’s Starry Night. This study asks two distinct questions. Can we use NST
    to manufacture pseudo crime scene images of shoe impressions by transferring the
    style of a crime scene image to a clean impression of a shoe? The idea is that
    the known, clean image will be transformed to take on the characteristics of a
    crime scene image, thereby providing a mechanism for researchers to generate pseudo
    crime scene images that can be used, for example, in training impression recognition
    algorithms. This is useful because there is a shortage of ground truth known crime
    scene-like data. We report that our NST procedure does not produce extremely convincing
    pseudo impressions but the results are nonetheless promising. The second question
    asks if we can improve crime scene/suspect shoe impression comparison by using
    NST as a preprocessing, sharpening step. The idea is that the “style” of welldefned
    edges of the clean impressions will be transferred to the crime scene image. We
    have a lineup of clean shoe impressions containing the impression of the shoe
    that created the crime scene image and several other impressions of shoes of the
    same make, model, and size. We compare the crime scene image to each of the shoes
    in the lineup using an algorithm that computes similarity scores. The matching
    shoe should give the highest score with high probability. Next, we combine the
    crime scene image with an aggregate image of all the clean shoe impressions in
    the lineup using NST. Then we repeat the comparison process with the NST image
    instead of the original crime scene image. We observe that, in half of the cases
    we studied, when we compare the NST image to each of the shoes in the lineup,
    we can more readily distinguish between the matching shoe and the non-matching
    shoes than when we do the comparisons with the original crime scene image.
