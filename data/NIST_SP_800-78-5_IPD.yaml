abstract:
- content: Federal Information Processing Standard 201-3 (FIPS 201-3) defines the
    requirements for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) life cycle activities, including
    identity proofing, registration, PIV Card issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201-3
    also defines the structure of an identity credential that includes cryptographic
    keys. This document contains the technical specifications needed for the mandatory
    and optional cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201-3, as well as the supporting
    infrastructure specified in FIPS 201-3 and the related NIST Special Publication
    (SP) 800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification, and NIST SP 800-76,
    Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification, which rely on cryptographic
    functions.
