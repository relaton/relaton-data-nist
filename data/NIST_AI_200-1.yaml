abstract:
- content: 'As artificial intelligence (AI) systems continue to be developed, humans
    will increasingly participate in human-AI interactions. Humans interact with AI
    systems to achieve particular goals. To ensure that AI systems contribute positively
    to human-AI interactions, it is important to examine human-AI tasks with an emphasis
    on human goals and outcomes. The AI Use Taxonomy aims to provide a flexible means
    of classifying how an AI system contributes to an outcome. The taxonomy sets forward
    16 AI use “activities” which are independent of AI techniques and domains. Tasks
    are combinations of one or more AI use activities. Future research includes applying
    the taxonomy to better understand measurement challenges for each activity. The
    taxonomy can contribute to an improved understanding of the architecture of human-AI
    tasks and help to foster positive, human-centered interactions with AI systems
    and optimal outcomes in the following ways: • Provides common terminology for
    describing outcome-based human-AI activities independent of AI techniques and
    domains • Enables cross-domain insights based on shared human-AI activities •
    Highlights commonalities in measurement and evaluation needs across disparate
    AI techniques • Facilitates the development of use cases • Facilitates the evaluation
    of trustworthiness characteristics and usability.'
