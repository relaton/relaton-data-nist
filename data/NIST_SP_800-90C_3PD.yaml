abstract:
- content: The NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-90 series of documents supports the
    generation of high-quality random bits for cryptographic and non-cryptographic
    use. SP 800-90A specifies several deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) mechanisms
    based on cryptographic algorithms. SP 800-90B provides guidance for the development
    and validation of entropy sources. This document (SP 800-90C) specifies constructions
    for the implementation of random bit generators (RBGs) that include DRBG mechanisms
    as specified in SP 800-90A and that use entropy sources as specified in SP 800-90B.
    Constructions for three classes of RBGs (namely, RBG1, RBG2, and RBG3) are specified
    in this document.
