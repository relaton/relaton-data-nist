abstract:
- content: Socio-economic forces in conjunction with the emergence and proliferation
    of technical advances in both hardware and software are changing the landscape
    of manufacturing robotics. This document discusses the factors that are altering
    the development and deployment ecosystems, specifically as they affect the measurement
    science necessary for enabling broader adoption of more capable and “smarter”
    robots for U.S. manufacturers.
