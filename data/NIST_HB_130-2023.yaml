abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 130 includes a compilation of model laws and regulations
    and related interpretations and guidelines designed to encourage uniformity in
    adoption and implementation of weights and measures laws and regulations. The
    model laws and regulations included in NIST Handbook 130 are adopted in various
    forms by many state, local, and some federal weights and measures authorities.
    Some authorities adopt the current versions as written; some use them as the basis
    of adoption, but from an earlier year; some use them as a guideline only; some
    elect to use their own laws or regulations; and some have no corresponding law
    or regulation in place. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    has a statutory responsibility to promote "cooperation with the states in securing
    uniformity in weights and measures laws and method of inspection" and publishes
    this and other NIST Handbooks in partial fulfillment of this responsibility. This
    2023 edition includes amendments made through the Committee on Laws and Regulations
    of the NCWM with technical guidance from the Office of Weights and Measures (OWM)
    of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and input from weights
    and measures officials and industry representatives. These amendments were adopted
    by the NCWM at its 107th Annual Meeting in July 2022. At the 1983 Annual Meeting,
    the NCWM voted to change the title of Handbook 130 from "Model State Laws and
    Regulations" was to be changed to "Uniform Laws and Regulations" to reflect that
    these Laws and Regulations are (a) intended to be standards rather than just guidelines,
    and (b) intended for adoption by political subdivisions other than states when
    deemed appropriate. In 1995 the title was changed to Uniform Laws and Regulations
    in the areas of legal metrology and motor fuel quality. In the 1997 Edition of
    Handbook 130 was changed from "Uniform Laws and Regulations the words "motor fuel
    quality" was changed to "engine fuel quality" to reflect changes made to the Uniform
    Engine Fuels, Petroleum Products, and Automotive Lubricants Law and Regulation.
    In 2018, the scope of the Fuels regulation was expanded to encompass the changing
    fuels in the marketplace, and the title to the Handbook was changed to how it
    appears today.
