abstract:
- content: This is the 2024 edition of energy price indices and discount factors for
    performing life-cycle cost analyses of energy and water conservation and renewable
    energy projects in federal facilities. It will be effective from the publication
    date to the publication of the 2025 edition. This publication supports the federal
    life cycle costing methodology described in 10 CFR 436A and OMB Circular A-94
    by updating the energy price projections and discount factors that are described,
    explained, and illustrated in NIST Handbook 135 (HB 135, Life-Cycle Costing Manual
    for the Federal Energy Management Program).
