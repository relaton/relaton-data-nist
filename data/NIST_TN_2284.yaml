abstract:
- content: the report outlines preliminary studies undertaken to assess the thermal
    and cold neutron beam performance of a pre-conceptual design of the NNS. The results
    demonstrate the possibility and feasibility for significant performance enhancements
    of the NNS for a similar scale reactor core that builds on experience with the
    NBSR design. Further improvements and optimizations will be explored later as
    the NNS design evolves.
