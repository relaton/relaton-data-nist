abstract:
- content: 'In this report, we address the following question: to what extent can
    machine learning assist a human with traditional text analysis, such as content
    analysis or grounded theory in the social sciences? In practice, such tasks require
    humans to review and categorize(e.g., by manually annotating the text with labels)
    a large sample of documents. We do not expect nor necessarily desire the machine
    to automate the tasks the human would otherwise perform, but rather want to find
    ways to help the human to perform the tasks more efficiently. We present a modular
    implementation of a system that incorporates supervised (active learning) and
    unsupervised (topic modeling) methods to assist humans with technical document
    annotation. The implemented system allows us to conduct user studies to evaluate
    the usefulness of machine assistance. We present results from two such user studies
    and highlight directions for future research.'
