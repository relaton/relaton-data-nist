abstract:
- content: This document provides details on the files available in the dataset "In
    situ thermographic measurements of single line scans performed for the Additive
    Manufacturing Benchmark Test Series (AM-Bench 2018)." These measurements are performed
    as part of the Additive Manufacturing Benchmark Test Series (AMBench) supporting
    the melt pool geometry (length) and cooling rate challenges (CHAL-AMB2018-02-MP-Length
    and CHAL-AMB2018-02-CR). The following sections provided details on the experiments
    and data files.
