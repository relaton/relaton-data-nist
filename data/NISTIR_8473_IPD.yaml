abstract:
- content: 'This document is the Cybersecurity Framework Profile (Profile) developed
    for the Electric Vehicle Extreme Fast Charging (EV/XFC) ecosystem and the subsidiary
    functions that support each of the four domains: (i) Electric Vehicles (EV); (ii)
    Extreme Fast Charging (XFC); (iii) XFC Cloud or Third-Party Operations; (iv) and
    Utility and Building Networks. This Profile provides a foundational profile that
    relevant parties may use to develop profiles specific to their organization to
    assess their cybersecurity posture as a part of their risk management process.
    The profile is intended to supplement, not replace, an existing risk management
    program or the current cybersecurity standards, regulations, and industry guidelines
    that are in current use by the EV/XFC industry.'
