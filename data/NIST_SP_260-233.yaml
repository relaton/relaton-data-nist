    Material® (SRM®) 1849b Infant/Adult Nutritional Formula I delivers certified or
    non-certified values for over 100 analytes. This material is intended to be used
    for the evaluation of methods for the determination of elements, amino acids,
    fatty acids, nucleotides, proximates, sugars, and vitamins and in this and similar
    matrices. The material was purchased pre-packaged from a commercial vendor. The
    measurement results used to assign values to the measurands were provided by NIST
    staff, the manufacturer, and/or interlaboratory comparison exercises. This document
    describes the material, measurement processes and results, and data analysis used
    to produce SRM 1849b.
