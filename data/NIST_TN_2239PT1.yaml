abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Alternatives
    for Resilient Communities (NIST ARC) software is an interactive tool for developing
    alternative sets of actions that meet community resilience and cost goals, given
    hazard and interdependency information and socio-economic data. Community resilience
    planning is challenging as it involves several large-scale systems and public
    sector decision-making with numerous stakeholders. The goal of NIST ARC is to
    decrease a community s burden in developing viable alternatives for stakeholder
    consideration. This technical note details NIST ARC s mathematical programming
    model, which is the leading technical contribution of NIST ARC. The model variables,
    parameters (data), and equations of the two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear
    programming model are described, with the full model given in the Appendix. Results
    for a realistic example designed to test the suitability of the mathematical programming
    model for supporting interactive community resilience planning are presented.
    Finally, the NIST ARC decision support application that enables the use and application
    of the model, the plans for its further development and testing, and its role
    within the broader set of NIST-funded tools and guidance for the Community Resilience
    Program are briefly described.
