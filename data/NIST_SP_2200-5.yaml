abstract:
- content: Every day, overweight and excessively heavy vehicles cause damage to roads,
    bridges, and other vehicle-based infrastructure. To protect this vital transportation
    infrastructure for the U.S., states have imposed weight limits for commercial
    and fleet transport vehicles. A common way for enforcing these weight limits is
    to guide trucks off the road to weigh stations where the vehicles can be weighed
    using static truck scales. A disadvantage of these dedicated weigh stations is
    that they take up a substantial amount of space (which is not always available)
    and time to conduct weighments, as well as cause delays to traffic flow that may
    impede commerce based on truck transport. A solution to these problems is the
    use of automatic weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems that are installed in the road
    and weigh vehicles as they pass by while maintaining their speed.For jurisdictions
    to effectively use a WIM system for direct enforcement of weight limits, the system
    must be evaluated against a recognized standard to establish suitability for its
    intended application. The vast majority of weighing instruments used for legal
    metrology purposes (including law enforcement) need to comply with the requirements
    in NIST Handbook 44. However, the NIST Handbook 44 does not (yet) cover WIM systems
    for direct enforcement.Although state and local jurisdictions use NIST Handbook
    44 to certify legal metrological instruments, it does not exclude them from using
    additional technical standards to certify certain instruments. New York City recently
    certified a WIM system to protect a critical section of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway
    (BQE) by designating it as a pilot project while efforts were made to amend NIST
    Handbook 44 to include WIM systems for direct enforcement.This publication discusses
    the main characteristics of WIM systems and how they can be used for direct enforcement.
    An overview of several alternative documentary standards that can be applied for
    certification of WIM systems is also provided, with further explanation regarding
    how New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) implemented the certification
    of the WIM system to begin issuing citations to overweight vehicles in an effort
    to protect the BQE.
