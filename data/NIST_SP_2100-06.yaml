abstract:
- content: On September 6 and 7, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) convened a roundtable discussion and workshop with a diverse group of forensic
    science thought leaders representing various local, state, federal, and private
    forensic laboratories, academia, and the legal system throughout the United States.
    This meeting gave participants the opportunity to provide their perspectives on
    major challenges to forensic science practices in the United States and how research
    and standards can address those challenges. This report summarizes the views and
    opinions expressed by participants during the plenary and breakout sessions.
