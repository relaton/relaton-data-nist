abstract:
- content: This publication provides a Strategic Plan for the Smart City Infrastructure
    (SCI) program of the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), the
    research laboratory of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The SCI program manages
    the Global Community Technology Challenge (GCTC), a nationwide public-private
    partnership of cities and communities; local and state government agencies; and
    private-sector for-profit and non-profit entities. The GCTC is dedicated to improving
    the urban, suburban, and rural ecosystems and residents’ overall quality of life
    through the integration of advanced cyberphysical systems and Internet of Things
    (IoT)-based technologies. NIST serves as coordinator for this partnership in collaboration
    with other federal agencies and offices that sponsor smart city-related projects
    and research activities. The convention “smart city,” is used generically throughout
    this document to represent any city, township, or community that develops, invests
    in, and integrates digital technologies to improve city services for the benefit
    of the community and its residents. This strategy is based on a consensus planning
    process chartered by the NIST SCI program in collaboration with the leadership
    of twelve GCTC technology sectors (i.e., working groups), who collectively represent
    over 220 regions, cities and communities that have initiated smart city programs
    or projects as GCTC member communities. This document aligns with the current
    Administration, Department of Commerce, and NIST strategic documents, and covers
    a planning period of three years, from 2024-2026.
