abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the stateless hash-based digital signature algorithm
    (SLH-DSA). Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to
    data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient
    of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third
    party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This
    is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature
    at a later time. SLH-DSA is based on SPHINCS+, which was selected for standardization
    as part of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process.
