abstract:
- content: The HIPAA Security Rule focuses on safeguarding electronic protected health
    information (ePHI) held or maintained by regulated entities. The ePHI that a regulated
    entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits must be protected against reasonably
    anticipated threats, hazards, and impermissible uses and/or disclosures. This
    publication provides practical guidance and resources that can be used by regulated
    entities of all sizes to protect ePHI and better understand the security concepts
    discussed in the HIPAA Security Rule.
