abstract:
- content: This publication describes a ballot definition common data format for the
    interchange of logical and physical ballot style information. It contains a UML
    (Unified Modeling Language) model of the election data and a JSON (JavaScript
    Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) format derived from the
    UML model. It contains background information regarding how geopolitical geography
    is structured and used in the model and schemas. It also provides usage examples
    for anticipated use-cases. The format is comprehensive and at the same time very
    flexible, able to accommodate election scenarios used throughout the U.S. It is
    part of a series of common data format specifications for voting equipment.
