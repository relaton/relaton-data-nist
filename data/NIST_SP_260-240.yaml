abstract:
- content: Standard Reference Material速 (SRM速) 3383 Yohimbe-Containing Solid Oral
    Dosage Form was developed as part of a collaborative effort between the National
    Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Institutes of Health
    Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS). SRM 3383 was produced from multiple commercial
    dietary supplements containing yohimbe to replicate typical analytical challenges
    associated with the measurement of yohimbine in a finished product sample matrix.
    The material was prepared at NIST and packaged by High Purity Standards, an experienced
    contract manufacturer. A certified value for yohimbine has been assigned based
    upon data obtained from NIST. A description of the material, sample preparations,
    results, and data analysis are discussed in the following report.
