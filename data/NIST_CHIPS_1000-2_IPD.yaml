abstract:
- content: There is an immediate need to make NIST research funded through the CHIPS
    Metrology Program available in a manner that guards intellectual property, protects
    U.S. security interests, is aligned with the approach used by NIST for access
    to research results, and is self-sustaining to meet future needs. Establishing
    a data exchange ecosystem will meet that need, giving stakeholders access to CHIPS
    Metrology research results and serving to catalyze breakthroughs in U.S. semiconductor
    manufacturing. We call this data exchange concept “METIS”—Metrology Exchange to
    Innovate in Semiconductors—after Metis, the Greek goddess of innovative ideas,
    good counsel, skill, and craft. The METIS concept leverages and builds upon currently
    existing data management systems and processes at NIST, an organization uniquely
    qualified to both produce and manage leading metrology research and technical
    data products. By designing the data ecosystem around and for research needed
    by the public, industry, and the scientific community, METIS serves as a virtual
    platform for curation of microelectronics research data and tools with security
    and controls to enable the final products to reach their intended recipients.
