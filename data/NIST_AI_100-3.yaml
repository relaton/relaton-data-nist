abstract:
- content: The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) glossary of terms
    related to trustworthy and responsible artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
    learning (ML) intends to promote a common understanding and effective communication
    among individuals and organizations seeking to operationalize trustworthy and
    responsible AI through approaches such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework
    (AI RMF). The glossary, like the AI RMF, is non-sector specific and use-case agnostic,
    designed to be flexible for all organizations and sectors of society to use. The
    continuing aim of the glossary is to provide a common language to improve discussions
    related to AI and to increase their effectiveness and efficiency.
