abstract:
- content: The NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government
    agencies, and other organizations to reduce cybersecurity risks. It offers a taxonomy
    of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization — regardless
    of its size, sector, or maturity — to better understand, assess, prioritize, and
    communicate its cybersecurity efforts. The Framework does not prescribe how outcomes
    should be achieved. Rather, it maps to resources that provide additional guidance
    on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes. This document
    explains Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 and its components and describes some of
    the many ways that it can be used.
