abstract:
- content: The document provides appropriate and useful guidelines for assessing the
    reliability of issuers of PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials. These issuers
    store personal information and issue credentials based on OMB policies and the
    standards published in response to HSPD-12. The reliability of an issuer is of
    utmost importance when an organization (e.g., a federal agency) is required to
    trust identity credentials that were created and issued by another organization.
    This trust relies on having the necessary level of assurance that the reliability
    of the issuing organization has been established through a formal authorization
    process.
