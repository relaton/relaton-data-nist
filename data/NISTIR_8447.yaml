abstract:
- content: The Food Nutrition and Safety Measurements Quality Assurance Program (FNSQAP)
    was launched in 2021. FNSQAP was established to assist laboratories in the development
    and validation of new analytical methods, in improving the quality of their analytical
    measurements, and in supporting compliance with federal regulations enforced by
    the US FDA, USDA, and other international bodies. Exercise 1 of this program offered
    the opportunity for laboratories to assess their in-house measurements of nutritional
    elements (calcium, iron, potassium, and sodium), toxic elements (arsenic, cadmium,
    lead, and mercury), water-soluble vitamins (folic acid), fat-soluble vitamins
    (vitamin K), contaminants (glyphosate and acrylamide), and dietary fiber in food
    and infant formula samples.
