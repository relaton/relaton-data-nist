abstract:
- content: 'This environmental scan provides a broad view of the forensic science
    environment (as of 2023) and characterizes high-level historical and current issues
    and trends that might impact near and long-term decisions by forensic science
    research and standards programs, including the NIST Forensic Science Program.
    A historical perspective is provided followed by a more detailed summary of various
    issues relating to the state of forensic science across five different landscapes:
    governance, economic, societal, scientific and technological, and legal and regulatory.
    Each landscape includes a discussion of several issues that are potentially relevant
    to the administration of forensic science research and standards programs in the
    United States. The relevance of each issue, and manner in which it might impact
    those programs, are discussed under the heading “Considerations for Forensic Science
    Research and Standards Programs” within each subsection and outline potential
    approaches and priorities that those programs might consider as part of their
    longer-term strategy moving forward.'
