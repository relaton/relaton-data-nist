abstract:
- content: The uncertainty of fracture toughness and associated fracture resistance
    curves for single edge-notched tension (SE(T) or SENT) specimens is a key component
    missing from widely accepted testing protocols. Complicating matters, these uncertainties
    are not easily calculated using traditional propagation-of-error techniques. Uncertainty
    estimates using Monte Carlo techniques for two test methods are presented and
    the effect of changing the distribution and tolerance specified for the measurement
    and input quantities on the results is investigated.
