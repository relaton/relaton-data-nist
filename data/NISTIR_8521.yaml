abstract:
- content: A novel approach for estimating transient heat release rate from fire images
    and video using deep learning techniques is presented. The heat release rate (HRR)
    is the most critical parameter in characterizing the fire hazard and thermal effects
    of a burning item. It is an effective indicator of the fire growth rate and fire
    size that is used extensively in both building fire safety design and firefighting
    operations. However, for outdoor fires, heat release rate measurements are usually
    not available due to lack of equipment.The goal of this report is to develop and
    demonstrate a novel technique “image calorimetry” for predicting heat release
    rate using video data and recurrent neural network models. The proposed methodology
    only requires video camera data and can be readily extended to outdoor fire experiments,
    with or without ambient wind. Results from the trained neural network model show
    excellent comparison between predicted and temporally evolving heat release rate
    measurements, with an overall accuracy score of 0.93.
