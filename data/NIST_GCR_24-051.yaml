abstract:
- content: 'Qualitative research to gain deeper insights about how voters mark, review,
    verify, and cast their ballots. Conducted as part of the work to update the human
    factors—accessibility, privacy, and usability—requirements in federal voting system
    standards and fill gaps in our understanding of how voters interact with ballot
    marking devices. From detailed observations of 35 voters marking both a pre-printed
    paper ballot and a ballot marking device, four themes emerged about the influences
    that shape attitudes about and behaviors during voting: • Past voting experiences
    shape expectations for the voting process. • Voters preferred ballot marking devices.
    • Voters did not have strong habits for verifying their printed ballots. • The
    use of ballot marking devices alone did not encourage verification of printed
    ballots.'
