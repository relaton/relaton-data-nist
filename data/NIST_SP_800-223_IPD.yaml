abstract:
- content: Security is an essential component of high-performance computing (HPC).
    HPC systems often differ based on the evolution of their system designs, the applications
    they run, and the missions they support. An HPC system may also have its own unique
    security requirements, follow different security guidance, and require tailored
    security solutions. Their complexity and uniqueness impede the sharing of security
    solutions and knowledge. This NIST Special Publication aims to standardize and
    facilitate the information and knowledge-sharing of HPC security using an HPC
    system reference model and key components as the basics of an HPC system lexicon.
    This publication also analyzes HPC threats, considers current HPC security postures
    and challenges, and makes best-practice recommendations.
