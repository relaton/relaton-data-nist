abstract:
- content: The Middle-Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act created the Public Safety
    Communications Research (PSCR) Division at the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) to investigate interoperability for public safety by improving
    wireless and broadband communications for first responders. The Public Safety
    Trust Fund (PSTF) established from this legislation and subsequent congressional
    funds enabled PSCR to conduct research through prize challenges to explore the
    potential of technology and the impact of Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) on public
    safety operations. Prize challenges help bring together industry leaders and experts
    to solve technology problems for first responders. Challenges have focused on
    performance, endurance, and technology-specific use case scenarios with requirements
    specific to first responder needs. This report provides a general overview of
    the PSCR UAS Portfolio, the history of PSCR UAS prize challenges, and the UAS
    prize challenge structure.
