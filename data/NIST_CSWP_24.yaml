abstract:
- content: 'Executive Order (EO) 14028, “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity,” tasks
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in coordination with
    the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other agencies, to initiate pilot programs
    for cybersecurity labeling. These labeling programs are intended to educate the
    public on the security capabilities of …software development practices. To inform
    this effort, the EO directs NIST to “…identify secure software development practices
    or criteria for a consumer software labeling program….” This document seeks to
    fulfill this directive by detailing the following areas: 1) the role of a scheme
    owner in a labeling program, 2) baseline technical criteria that can inform a
    label, 3) labeling presentation criteria, 4) conformity assessment criteria, and
    5) a detailed discussion concerning consumer education and usability.'
