abstract:
- content: As natural disasters have increased in frequency and magnitude, there has
    been an increasing need to understand what underlying factors are likely to lead
    to faster recovery and more resilient communities. One way of addressing this
    need has been to develop sets of indicators or indicator indices that serve as
    proxy measurements for resilience, which is an emergent system property and cannot
    be directly measured. Once operationalized, resilience indicators can be used
    for planning, making funding decisions, and tracking program progress. Since all
    of these uses can have profound effects on community well-being, it is important
    that indicator selection involves stakeholders and is based on the best available
    science. For the latter criteria, this can be determined by assessing what evidence
    is used to justify indicator choices and validating candidate indicators on observed
    data. Previous reviews of resilience indicator frameworks have attempted to gauge
    the state of evidence used for indicator selection by looking for consensus of
    indicator choices across different frameworks. Similar to a multi-expert elicitation,
    it is inferred that agreement on an indicator among frameworks points to strong
    evidence that the indicator is a good measurement of resilience. Using a novel
    categorization methodology based in systems science, this study reviews a small
    set of resilience frameworks for indicator consensus. Compared to previous reviews,
    this methodology allows for clear distinction between consensus of concepts and
    consensus of indicators to measure concepts. Our results show two new insights.
    The first is that common usage of an indicator does not mean that agreement also
    exists on what the indicator is actually measuring. The second is that even if
    a common indicator has agreement on what concepts are measured, it is not guaranteed
    that this consensus is backed by high quality evidence. These results call into
    question the practice of reviewing many frameworks to identify common indicators
    during model development, and instead points to the need for more detailed assessment
    of background evidence and indicator validation.
