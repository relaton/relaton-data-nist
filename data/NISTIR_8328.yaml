abstract:
- content: Access time generally describes the time associated with the establishment
    of a talk pathupon user request to speak and has been identified as a key component
    of quality of experience (QoE) in voice communications. The National Institute
    of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR)
    division has previouslydeveloped an access time measurement method [1]. Improvements
    were implemented inthe access delay measurement method to better handle the idiosyncrasies
    of the variouspush-to-talk (PTT) technologies tested. These improvements include
    a more robust audioalignment procedure, and graceful communications failure detection
    and handling. Thispaper covers those improvements to the access delay measurement
    system, results of testingProject 25 (P25) technologies with and without encryption
    turned on, as well as someinitial Long Term Evolution (LTE) measurements.
