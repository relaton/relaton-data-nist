abstract:
- content: A small sample of powder was dropped in a specified manner from a dispenser
    at the top of an enclosure. The reflectance of the powder distribution at the
    bottom of the enclosure was measured with respect to a layer of the same powder
    in a specified form. One hundred times the reflectance measured in this way was
    the measure of dispersibility, The dispersibility of powdered sodium bicarbonate
    was studied as a function of particle size and the dispersibility was found to
    be a maximum for powder with a mean particle diameter of 15 microns.
