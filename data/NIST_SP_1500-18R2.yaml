abstract:
- content: 'The NIST Research Data Framework (RDaF) is a multifaceted and customizable
    tool that aims to help shape the future of open data access and research data
    management (RDM). The RDaF will allow organizations and individual researchers
    to develop their own RDM strategy. Though NIST is leading the RDaF, most of the
    content in the current version 2.0, which supersedes preliminary V1.0 and interim
    V1.5, was obtained via engagement with national and international leaders in the
    research data community. NIST held a series of three plenary and 15 stakeholder
    workshops from October 2021 to September 2023. Workshop attendees represented
    many stakeholder sectors: US government agencies, national laboratories, academia,
    industry, non-profit organizations, publishers, professional societies, trade
    organizations, and funders (public and private), including international organizations.
    The audience for the RDaF is the entire research data community in all disciplines—the
    biological, chemical, medical, social, and physical sciences and the humanities.
    The RDaF is applicable from the organization to the project level and encompasses
    a wide array of job roles involving RDM, from executives and Chief Data Officers
    to publishers, funders, and researchers. The RDaF is a map of the research data
    space that uses a lifecycle approach with six stages to organize key information
    concerning RDM and research data dissemination. Through a community-driven and
    in-depth process, NIST identified and defined specific, high-priority topics and
    subtopics for each lifecycle stage. The topics and subtopics are programmatic
    and operational activities, concepts, and other important factors relevant to
    RDM which form the foundation of the framework. This foundation enables organizations
    and individual researchers to use the RDaF for self-assessment of their RDM status.
    Each subtopic has several informative references—resources such as guidelines,
    standards, and policies—to help a user understand or implement that subtopic.
    As such, the RDaF may be considered a “best practices” document. Fourteen overarching
    themes—topic areas identified as pervasive throughout the framework—illustrate
    the connections among the six lifecycle stages. Finally, the RDaF includes eight
    sample profiles for common job functions or roles. Each profile contains topics
    and subtopics an individual in the given role needs to consider in fulfilling
    their RDM responsibilities. Individual researchers and organizations involved
    in the research data lifecycle will be able to tailor these sample profiles or
    generate entirely new profiles for their specific job function. The methodologies
    used to generate the content of this publication, RDaF V2.0, are described in
    detail. An interactive web application has been developed and released that provides
    an interface for all the components of the RDaF mentioned above and replicates
    this document. The web application is easy and intuitive to navigate and provides
    new functionality enabled by the interactive environment.'
