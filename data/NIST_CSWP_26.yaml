abstract:
- content: Fault detection often depends on the specific order of inputs that establish
    states which eventually lead to a failure. However, beyond basic structural coverage
    metrics, it is often difficult to determine if code has been exercised sufficiently
    to ensure confidence in its functions. Measures are needed to ensure that relevant
    combinations of input values have been tested with adequate diversity of ordering
    to ensure correct operation. Combinatorial testing and combinatorial coverage
    measures have been applied to many types of applications but have some deficiencies
    for verifying and testing state-based systems where the response depends on both
    input values and the current system state. In such systems, internal states change
    as input values are processed. Examples include network protocols, which may be
    in listening, partial connection, full connection, disconnected, and many other
    states depending on the values of packet fields and the order of packets received.
    Similarly, merchant account balances in credit card systems change continuously
    as transactions are processed. This publication introduces a notion of ordered
    t-way combinations, proves a result regarding the construction of adequate blocks
    of test inputs, and discusses the application of the results to verify and test
    state-based systems.
