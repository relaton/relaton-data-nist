abstract:
- content: This report documents an experimental program designed to collect data
    and information to evaluate the performance of models developed to estimate the
    electrical high energy arcing fault (HEAF) hazard. This report covers full-scale
    laboratory experiments using representative nuclear power plant (NPP) three-phase
    electrical equipment. Equipment included medium-voltage metal-enclosed bus ducts
    and switchgear and low-voltage metal-enclosed switchgear. Electrical, thermal,
    and pressure data were recorded for each experiment and documented in this report.
    The experiments include five medium-voltage switchgear, two medium-voltage non-segregated
    bus ducts, and three low-voltage switchgear. These experiments differed from past
    programs in that the effects to adjacent and nearby equipment were also evaluated.
    The data collected supports characterization of the HEAF hazard, and these results
    will be used to complement the data used for HEAF hazard modeling tools and support
    potential improvements in fire probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methods.
