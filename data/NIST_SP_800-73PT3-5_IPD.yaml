abstract:
- content: FIPS 201 defines the requirements and characteristics of government-wide
    interoperable identity credentials. It specifies that these identity credentials
    must be stored on a smart card and that additional common identity credentials,
    known as derived PIV credentials, may be issued by a federal department or agency
    and used when a PIV Card is not practical. This document contains the technical
    specifications to interface with the smart card to retrieve and use the PIV identity
    credentials. The specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and
    PIV Card functions. The goals are addressed by specifying a PIV data model, card
    edge interface, and application programming interface. Moreover, this document
    enumerates requirements for the options and branches in international integrated
    circuit card standards. The specifications go further by constraining interpretations
    of the normative standards to ease implementation, facilitate interoperability,
    and ensure performance in a manner tailored for PIV applications.
