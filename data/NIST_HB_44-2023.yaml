abstract:
- content: NIST Handbook 44 includes specifications, tolerances, and other technical
    requirements for weighing and measuring devices. These requirements are intended
    to encourage the design, installation, testing, and use of weighing and measuring
    devices that provide for accurate, repeatable measurements; facilitate clear and
    transparent transactions for buyer and seller; and do not facilitate fraud. Handbook
    44 is adopted by many state, local, and some federal weights and measures authorities
    to apply to commercial weighing and measuring equipment and associated equipment
    and for use in applications for law enforcement and the collection of statistical
    information by government agencies. NIST has a statutory responsibility for cooperation
    with the states in securing uniformity of weights and measures laws and methods
    of inspection and publishes this and other NIST Handbooks in partial fulfillment
    of this responsibility. NIST Handbook 44 was first published in 1949, having been
    preceded by similar handbooks of various designations and in several forms, beginning
    in 1918; the handbook is now typically published on an annual basis. This 2023
    edition includes amendments made through the Committee on Specifications and Tolerances
    of the National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) with technical guidance
    from the Office of Weights and Measures (OWM) of the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) and input from weights and measures officials and industry
    representatives. These amendments were adopted by the NCWM at its 107th Annual
    Meeting in July 2022.
