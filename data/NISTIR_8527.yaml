abstract:
- content: 'On September 5–8, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) held the second Standards and Performance Metrics for On‐Road Automated
    Vehicles Workshop. This four‐day virtual event provided updates on NIST’s recent
    work in automated vehicles (AVs) and gave stakeholders an opportunity to provide
    feedback and input on current and future NIST research. The workshop included
    high‐level keynote presentations, a series of industry keynote presentations,
    and NIST presentations on its current AV activities. The industry keynotes and
    NIST presentations were paired with breakout sessions that discussed NIST’s progress,
    community challenges, and stakeholder research needs in six key areas: systems
    interaction, perception, cybersecurity, communications, artificial intelligence,
    and digital infrastructure. There was general agreement that developing standards
    allows for better comparisons and evaluations of emerging technologies. Other
    key themes included: 1) Digital technologies for automation and related security/privacy
    concerns, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and smart communication
    technologies (i.e., vehicle‐to‐vehicle (V2V), vehicle‐to‐infrastructure (V2I),
    and vehicle‐to‐everything (V2X)), 2) Need for standardized or common language
    to improve information sharing, 3) Open data sets to support and validate technical
    advances and standardization across system components and areas (i.e., standards
    evolving in parallel with technology), and 4) Pivotal role for NIST as a convener
    to bring diverse stakeholders together for knowledge exchange and cross‐industry
    dialogue.'
