abstract:
- content: Among the chief topic areas of Industry 4.0, digital thread technology
    offers the opportunity for increased productivity, efficiency, and traceability
    throughout a productâ€™s lifecycle. While the basic concept of digital thread is
    easy to realize by specifying aggregation of data from multiple stages of an entity's
    life cycle, digital threads must contain internal representations and associations
    of data across the life cycle to bring about improved traceability features and
    promised productivity. In this work, we bring missing pieces into digital threads
    to realize future production, traceability, and efficiency-increasing capabilities
    within the design, planning, execution, and quality stages of discrete part manufacturing.
    Namely, we (1) developed a standards-based digital thread using standards commonly
    found in the industry, specifically STEP AP242, unstandardized NC, MTConnect,
    and QIF standards, (2) perform spatial alignment within the four stages to geometries
    of interest defined through STEP AP242 shape aspects, and (3) perform temporal
    alignment of execution data by identifying ISO 8061 timestamp intervals where
    the geometric features were actively worked on. With this work, we hope to influence
    ongoing standards development in the four previously mentioned standards and standardize
    the development of future digital threads, such as ISO 23247, by providing a standards-based
    methodology that allows for internal association of the data within the thread
