abstract:
- content: This document provides guidance on how an organization can use metrics
    to identifies the adequacy of an in-place security controls, policies, and procedures.
    It provides an approach to help management decide where to invest in additional
    security protection resources or identify and evaluate nonproductive controls.
    It explains the metric development and implementation process and how it can also
    be used to adequately justify security control investments. The results of an
    effective metric program can provide useful data for directing the allocation
    of information security resources and should simplify the preparation of performance-related
    reports.
