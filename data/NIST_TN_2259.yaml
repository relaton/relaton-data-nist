abstract:
- content: This paper describes the probability of successful delivery (PSuD) measurement
    method for every word critical (EWC) and average message intelligibility (AMI)
    mission-critical voice (MCV) communications contexts. The PSuD measurement is
    a component of the MCV quality of experience (QoE) system developed by National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research
    Division (PSCR). In this paper, we present the probabilityiser (PBI), a tool that
    simulates an unreliable audio channel. Using the PBI we validate the PSuD measurement
    and demonstrate the measurement's utility on audio encoded with various codecs.
