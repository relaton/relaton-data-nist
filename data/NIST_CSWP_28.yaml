abstract:
- content: Manufacturers are increasingly targeted in cyber-attacks. Small manufacturers
    are particularly vulnerable due to limitations in staff and resources to operate
    facilities and manage cybersecurity. Security segmentation is a cost-effective
    and efficient security design approach for protecting cyber assets by grouping
    them based on both their communication and security requirements. This paper outlines
    a six-step approach that manufacturers can follow to implement security segmentation
    and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities in their manufacturing environments. The security
    architecture resulting from the security segmentation design activities is a foundational
    preparation step for additional security strategies like Zero Trust.
