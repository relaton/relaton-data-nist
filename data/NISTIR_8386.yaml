abstract:
- content: In most current applications of iris recognition, matching is done by computer
    algorithms. The dominant algorithms are based on the work of John Daugman and
    are well understood because of the extensive analysis in the literature of iris2pi
    (the shorthand name for the Daugman algorithms). However, the internals of the
    dominant algorithms are not intuitive â€“ the features that lead to the determination
    of a match between two iris images are not obvious to a casual observer. In forensic
    cases, evidence may be presented to non-technical people. Hence there is interest
    in the forensic community in human adjudication of matches between iris images,
    where the human relies upon easily understood visible features. This paper presents
    an analysis of the distribution of visible features in the human eye that may
    be of use in assessing the likelihood of a set of visible features occurring in
    two eyes by chance.
