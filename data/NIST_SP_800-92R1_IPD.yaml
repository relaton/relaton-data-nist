abstract:
- content: A log is a record of events that occur within an organizationâ€™s computing
    assets, including physical and virtual platforms, networks, services, and cloud
    environments. Log management is the process for generating, transmitting, storing,
    accessing, and disposing of log data. It facilitates log usage and analysis for
    many purposes, including identifying and investigating cybersecurity incidents,
    finding operational issues, and ensuring that records are stored for the required
    period of time. This document defines a playbook intended to help any organization
    plan improvements to its cybersecurity log management.
