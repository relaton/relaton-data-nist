abstract:
- content: Additive manufacturing (AM) is an important enabler of Industry 4.0 but
    there are several hurdles that need to be overcome to realize the full potential
    of AM. These challenges include the need for a data infrastructure that supports
    the sharing of data generated by the technologies as they mature, and data interoperability
    is critical to a sustainable data infrastructure that is widely accessible. This
    paper outlines the need for building a common data stack for an interoperable
    AM data infrastructure. At the foundation is a common data dictionary (CDD),which
    defines a primary technical vocabulary for the AM community in logical buckets.
    On top of the CDD is a common data model (CDM), which defines the hierarchy and
    relationships of the terms in the CDD and enables the data to be linkable in a
    complex data system. The CDM empowers information integration and sharing throughout
    the lifecycles and value chains for different AM technologies. The comprehensiveness
    of the properties defined in the CDM makes AM data reusable. To enable the exchange
    of data between different systems, common data exchange formats (CDEFs) transform
    the CDM into targeted data packages. The design philosophy of the CDD, CDM, and
    CDEF are described to accelerate the development and adoption of AM technologies
    across alliances.
