abstract:
- content: Turnout gear is increasingly recognized as a potential source of per- and
    polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure to firefighters. To determine the type,
    concentration, and prevalence of PFAS potentially present in new firefighter turnout
    gear, fifty-three nonvolatile, semivolatile, and volatile PFAS were quantified
    in twenty textiles used in the construction of firefighter turnout gear. Between
    one and seventeen PFAS were observed and quantified in each textile, with higher
    numbers of detections and higher concentrations of PFAS present in moisture barrier
    and outer shell textiles compared with thermal liner textiles. Three fluorotelomerization-derived
    PFAS with six perfluorinated carbons, 6:2 fluorotelomer methacrylate, 6:2 fluorotelomer
    alcohol, and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid, were quantified at the highest concentrations
    of any individual PFAS, up to 1,570 µg/kg ± 140 µg/kg (mean ± standard deviation
    of triplicate measurements), 613 µg/kg ± 15 µg/kg and 393 µg/kg ± 98 µg/kg, respectively.
    These three PFAS were not detected in outer shells that had not received fluoropolymer
    treatments which could indicate they were remnant raw materials from side-chain
    fluorinated polymer manufacturing. Also widely identified were two compounds with
    four perfluorinated carbons; perfluorobutane sulfonic acid and perfluorobutane
    sulfonamide. Perfluorocarboxylic acids, especially those with fewer than six perfluorinated
    carbons, were nearly universally identified, but entirely at concentrations below
    40 µg/kg. In contrast, PFAS with eight or more perfluorinated carbons, such as
    perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, were present at summed
    concentrations below 2 µg/kg in all textiles. The wide variation in summed PFAS
    concentrations among each textile type suggests that the amount of PFAS present
    in new turnout gear could vary widely based on the specific textiles used in gear
    manufacturing.
