abstract:
- content: Continuous temperature monitoring of vaccines during distribution and storage
    is critical to ensuring vaccination efficacy. Exposure to inappropriate storage
    temperatures can degrade vaccine potency, putting products and patients at risk
    if excursions go undetected. Digital temperature data loggers are widely used
    by U.S. vaccine providers to maintain a continuous record of vaccine storage temperature
    history. However, whether specific handling or usage conditions contribute to
    measurement drift in data loggers is not well known. Here we show that data logger
    calibration status is largely unaffected by typical usage conditions encountered
    at the vaccine provider level. Forty commercial digital data logger devices representing
    eight unique models marketed for use in vaccine temperature monitoring were evaluated
    in a two-year period during 2019-2021. The devices were calibrated upon receipt,
    subjected to trials designed to simulate typical usage conditions, and then recalibrated
    periodically to evaluate potential measurement drift. Simulated usage conditions
    included daily use in vaccine refrigerators and freezers, battery changes, local
    transport, cross-country shipment, and long-term storage. Out-of-tolerance calibration
    measurements were extremely rare, and the few failures we detected did not appear
    to be correlated with any of the usage trials performed during the two-year study
    period. These findings support extending data logger recalibration intervals when
    paired with concurrent manufacturer-supplied device stability data and/or intermediate
    data logger verification checks performed in the field.
