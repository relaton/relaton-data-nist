abstract:
- content: Accessible vote by mail (AVBM) provides options for voters with disabilities
    to complete their absentee or vote by mail ballots independently and privately.
    AVBM is especially important for voters with print disabilities that make it difficult
    to read or handle paper. This report reviews current elections offices practices
    in administering accessible vote by mail and considers their innovations and current
    challenges. One of the most important challenges is difficulties exchanging voter
    data and ballot style information between the election management systems and
    the AVBM system. A strong Common Data Format for ballot style data interchange
    would make providing AVBM more efficient. With the use of AVBM and electronic
    ballot return growing, strong standards will also support stronger cybersecurity
    practices while providing voters with print disabilities equal access to voting
    by mail. Recommendations include gathering more detailed information about administrative
    practices, assessing the risks and benefits for different methods of electronic
    return, and investigating methods for directly counting an AVBM ballot without
    replication, including best practices for how voter selections are encoded.\
