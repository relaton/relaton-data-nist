abstract:
- content: Standard Reference Material (SRM) 967b Creatinine in Frozen Human Serum
    is intended for use in validating creatinine measurement procedures used by in
    vitro diagnostics manufacturers, reference laboratories, and clinical laboratories
    in the United States and globally. A unit of SRM 967b consists of two 1 mL vials
    each of two levels of creatinine for a total of four vials per unit. This publication
    documents the production, analytical methods, and computations involved in characterizing
    this product.
