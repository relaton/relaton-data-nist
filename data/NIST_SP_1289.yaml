abstract:
- content: This document is designed to help researchers in the United States navigate
    and comply with requirements and best practices for human subjects research, with
    specific emphasis on biometric and forensic science research. The purpose of this
    document is to summarize requirements and best practices involved in Institutional
    Review Board (IRB) approval, consent forms, and data use agreements, when conducting
    biometric and forensic science research involving human subjects and distributing
    the resulting data. This document also provides a variety of resources from multiple
    sources to help navigate the IRB approval process. The process of beginning a
    human subjects research project requires several considerations to be made to
    protect the rights of the participants including approval by IRBs; writing, releasing,
    and collecting consent forms; and collecting, documenting, and using data for
    the execution of the research and the potential publishing of the findings.
