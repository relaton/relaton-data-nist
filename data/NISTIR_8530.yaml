abstract:
- content: The definitions of core metrological terms, especially quantity, quantity
    value, and unit, have been the subject of years of wrangling in standards organizations.
    A chronic disagreement exists over whether quantities are conceptualized primarily
    as mathematical entities or as physical ones. This report provides a unified model
    into which all of the competing definitions can be mapped and productively integrated.
    This model should enable software that interacts with measurement systems to be
    more insulated from changing and conflicting metrological terminology.
