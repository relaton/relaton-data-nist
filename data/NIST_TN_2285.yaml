abstract:
- content: Bi-directional probes are utilized throughout fire research and testing
    to measure fire induced flows due to their ability to measure flow which changes
    direction, and to withstand hostile environments. However, they are not available
    commercially and researchers must acquire them through custom fabrication. S-type
    probes (S-probes) work on the same principle as bi-directional probes thereby
    offering the same benefits. However, S-probes also feature reliable manufacturing
    and calibration standards. For the first time the performance of bi-directional
    and S-probes are compared in side-by-side experiments. Measurements of a steady
    flow in a well-characterized wind tunnel were examined and the probes were used
    to measure the velocity profile across a turbulent jet from a blower fan. In both
    scenarios, the S-probe performed comparable to or better than the bi-directional
    probe in terms of accuracy. The results demonstrate the S-probe as a suitable
    alternative to the bi-directional probe for measurements of fire-induced flow.
