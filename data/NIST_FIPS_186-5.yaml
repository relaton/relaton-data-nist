abstract:
- content: This standard specifies a suite of algorithms that can be used to generate
    a digital signature. Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications
    to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient
    of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third
    party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This
    is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature
    at a later time.
