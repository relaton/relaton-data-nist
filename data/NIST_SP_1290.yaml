abstract:
- content: Cooking and baking using a kitchen scale is a fun way to build metric system
    abilities and apply measurement techniques. This recipe series is ideal for both
    new and experienced chefs. Completing a NIST metric recipe is an opportunity to
    apply culinary math, develop measurement skills, interpret instructions, complete
    steps in a necessary sequence, troubleshoot, build self-confidence, and enjoy
    the delicious results. Cooking and baking activities develop fine motor skills
    and coordination, practice selecting appropriate cooking tools, opening containers,
    mixing, pouring without spilling, counting, weighing, as well as reading and interpreting
    a digital scale readout or oven thermometer. This printable recipe card series
    is best when printed on cardstock. Companion resources are available on the NIST
    Metric Cooking website.
