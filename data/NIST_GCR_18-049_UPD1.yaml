abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a long and
    impressive history of seeking to improve the safety of buildings, their occupants,
    and emergency responders through studies of building failures. Since 1969, NIST
    has investigated about 40 earthquakes, hurricanes, building and construction failures,
    tornadoes, and fires. These studies have resulted in major and far reaching changes
    to building and fire codes, standards, and practices. The study of disaster and
    failure events is essential for improving the performance of buildings and infrastructure,
    the safety of building occupants, and for evaluating the adequacy of codes, standards,
    practices, evacuation and emergency responseprocedures, and the current state-of-knowledge
    for structures. The results of disaster and failure studies help NIST develop
    community-scale loss estimation tools to predict consequences of disasters, leading
    to increased resilience.
