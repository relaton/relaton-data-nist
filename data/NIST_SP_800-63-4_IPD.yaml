abstract:
- content: These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing
    digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or
    use of standards outside of this purpose. The guidelines cover identity proofing
    and authentication of users (such as employees, contractors, or private individuals)
    interacting with government information systems over networks. They define technical
    requirements in each of the areas of identity proofing, registration, authenticators,
    management processes, authentication protocols, federation, and related assertions.
    This publication will supersede NIST Special Publication 800-63-3.
