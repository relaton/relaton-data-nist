abstract:
- content: This document provides the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Version 1.1 implementation
    details developed for the manufacturing environment. The “Manufacturing Profile”
    of the CSF can be used as a roadmap for reducing cybersecurity risk for manufacturers
    that is aligned with manufacturing sector goals and industry best practices. This
    Manufacturing Profile provides a voluntary, risk-based approach for managing cybersecurity
    activities and reducing cyber risk to manufacturing systems. The Manufacturing
    Profile is meant to enhance but not replace current cybersecurity standards and
    industry guidelines that the manufacturer is embracing.
