abstract:
- content: The objective of this Cybersecurity Profile is to identify an approach
    to assess the cybersecurity posture of Hybrid Satellite Networks (HSN) systems
    that provide services such as satellite-based systems for communications, position,
    navigation, and timing (PNT), remote sensing, weather monitoring, and imaging.
    The HSN systems may interact with other government systems and the Critical Infrastructure
    as defined by the Department of Homeland Security to provide increased resiliency.
    This Profile will consider the cybersecurity of all the interacting systems that
    form the HSN rather than the traditional approach of the government acquiring
    the entire satellite system that includes the satellite bus, payloads, and ground
    system. NIST is developing a consistent approach to better understand the attack
    surface, incorporate security, and achieve greater resilience for space systems
    that may be leveraged by critical infrastructure owners and operators, the DoD,
    or other government missions.
