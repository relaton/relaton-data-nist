abstract:
- content: This guide provides small-to-medium sized businesses (SMB), specifically
    those who have modest or no cybersecurity plans in place, with considerations
    to kick-start their cybersecurity risk management strategy by using the NIST Cybersecurity
    Framework (CSF) 2.0. The guide also can assist other relatively small organizations,
    such as non-profits, government agencies, and schools. It is a supplement to the
    NIST CSF and is not intended to replace it.
