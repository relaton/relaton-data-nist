abstract:
- content: Standard Reference Material (SRM) 917d D-Glucose (Dextrose) is certified
    as a chemical substance of known high purity. It is intended for use in calibrating
    measuring systems for glucose determinations employed in clinical analysis. A
    unit of SRM 917d consists of one bottle containing 50 g of crystalline D-glucose.
    This publication documents the production, analytical methods, and computations
    involved in characterizing this product.
