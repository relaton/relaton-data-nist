abstract:
- content: The FY 2018 summary, prepared by the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST), compiles the reports provided by 23 participating agencies
    listed in Appendix A. In these reports, agencies document any new use of GUS in
    lieu of VCS during FY 2018 and provide a rationale for each new use. Agencies
    also list any rescinded GUS in lieu of VCS during the past year. Agencies briefly
    describe their activities undertaken to carry out provisions described in Circular
    A-119. Individual agency reports may be found at https://standards.gov/NTTAA/agency/index.cfm?fuseaction=agencyReports.main.
    For FY 2018, federal agencies reported eight new GUS used in lieu of VCS as noted
    in Appendix B. EPA reported seven GUS dealing with methods for determining emissions
    of various gases, and one for validating field measurement methods. As reported
    in Appendix C, in FY 2018, three GUS used in lieu of VCS were rescinded by agencies.
    DOT rescinded 49 CFR 571.304, incorporated in 2016. Both EPA Method 25 and EPA
    Method 25A were incorporated in 2001 and are still in use, however EPA rescinded
    them from their report as their use does not meet the reporting requirements of
    the NTTAA.As reported in Appendix D, two GUS used in lieu of VCS were reported
    in FY 2016 by DOT but were not included in the FY 2016 Appendix D. These two GUS
    are now being noted and included in the overall total of GUS reported in lieu
    of VCS.
