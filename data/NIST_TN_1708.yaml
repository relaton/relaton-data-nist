abstract:
- content: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is working to
    reduce the risk of fire spread in Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) communities.
    An objective of this work is to develop first generation tools for improved risk
    assessment and risk mitigation in WUI communities at risk from wildfires. These
    tools will be developed and tested through a coordinated effort that includes
    laboratory and field measurements, physics-based fire behavior models, and economic
    cost analysis models. NIST and Texas Forest Service (TFS) worked together in October
    2010 to train TFS personnel in the NIST-developed WUI data collection methodology.
    While the fires that started on February 27, 2011 were still burning around Amarillo,
    NIST and TFS decided to deploy the joint Team and document the WUI fire event
    loses and fire behavior. The Tanglewood WUI fire in the outskirts of Amarillo
    was responsible for the destruction of approximately 101 structures including
    35 residences. Field measurements included structure particulars, specifically
    building construction materials, proximity and type of combustibles to the structure,
    and damage to wildland and residential vegetation. Documentation included over
    29 000 photographs. The data collection and analysis will be documented in two
    phases, an initial reconnaissance/overview report and a technical report. This
    summary report will address the particulars of the joint NIST/TFS deployment and
    the data collection methodology used. Additionally, this report provides a summary
    of the primary structures lost. A second more detailed technical report will provide
    the event timeline reconstruction and general fire behavior observations as well
    as investigate the impacts of structure attributes, landscaping characteristics,
    topographical features and wildland fire exposure on structure survivability
