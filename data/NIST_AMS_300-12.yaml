abstract:
- content: In the model-based enterprise (MBE) paradigm, enterprises are fueled by
    the digital thread, an authoritative, integrated information flow that connects
    all phases of the product life cycle. The digital thread enables use of data-driven
    processes to build knowledge, make decisions, manage requirements, and control
    manufacturing execution. As information about a product moves through the supply
    chain, different systems consume or modify that information for a variety of reasons.
    Associating persistent and universally uniqueidentifiers, in combination with
    human-readable identifiers, to key engineering requirements enables the enterprise
    to track all information related to that requirement over the life of the product.
    Neither widely-used product data standards nor commercial engineering software
    adequately support universally unique identifiers (UUIDs). This is a major roadblock
    to realizing the promises of the digital thread and model-based enterprise. This
    paper presents current support for UUIDs in digital thread standards, use cases
    and requirements for UUIDs in the product life cycle, research results, and finally,
    makes recommendations for use of universal identifiers in commonly used product
    data standards.
