abstract:
- content: The CSF 2.0 represents a suite of resources (documents and applications)
    that can be used individually, together, or in combination over time as cybersecurity
    needs change and capabilities evolve. NIST’s materials are designed to reach all
    audiences and to span across industries and organization types—and this new set
    of Quick Start Guides focus on popular ways ‘how’ the CSF can be implemented for
    the goal of implementing and accessing security solutions quickly. This Quick
    Start Guide covers the creation and use of CSF Organizational Profiles.
