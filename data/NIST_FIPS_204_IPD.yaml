abstract:
- content: Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data
    and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient
    of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third
    party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This
    is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature
    at a later time. This standard specifies ML-DSA, a set of algorithms that can
    be used to generate and verify digital signatures. ML-DSA is believed to be secure
    even against adversaries in possession of a large-scale quantum computer.
