abstract:
- content: The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) resident in
    nonfederal systems and organizations is of paramount importance to federal agencies
    and can directly impact the ability of the Federal Government to successfully
    conduct its essential missions and functions. This publication provides federal
    and nonfederal organizations with assessment procedures and a methodology that
    can be employed to conduct assessments of the security requirements in NIST Special
    Publication 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal
    Systems and Organizations. The assessment procedures are flexible and can be customized
    to the needs of organizations and assessors. Security assessments can be conducted
    as independent, third-party assessments or as government-sponsored assessments.
    The assessments can also be applied with various degrees of rigor based on customer-defined
    depth and coverage attributes. The findings and evidence produced during the assessments
    can facilitate risk-based decisions by organizations related to the security requirements.
