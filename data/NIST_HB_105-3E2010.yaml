abstract:
- content: These specifications and tolerances are recommended as minimum requirements
    for standards used by state and local weights and measures officials and others
    in the regulatory verification of meters used in quantity determination of liquid
    commodities. Other users may find this handbook helpful in the design of volumetric
    standards, but the requirements should not be considered mandatory for special
    applications outside the scope of regulatory weights and measures.
