abstract:
- content: One of the major issues for voting systems today is whether they provide
    voters with a meaningful opportunity to verify their ballot before casting it.
    This opportunity is important in helping them vote their intent by catching errors
    or omissions made during marking, such as skipping a contest or mis-marking a
    selection. It is also an opportunity to confirm that whether the ballot is marked
    by hand or printed by a BMD, it accurately reflects their choices – including
    finding any malicious changes (or software errors) made by the voting system between
    the voter’s review and the printing of the ballot. This review of the literature
    was done in preparation for research to understand how voters approach the task
    of marking, reviewing, verifying, and casting a ballot. We included not only research
    on voting systems and voting, but on related issues of trust, privacy, and mental
    models.
