abstract:
- content: This recommendation provides technical guidelines for the implementation
    of standards-based, secure, reliable credentials that are issued by federal departments
    and agencies to individuals who possess and prove control of their valid PIV Card.
    These credentials can be either public key infrastructure (PKI)-based like the
    PIV Card or non PKI-based but verified by the individual's home agency. The scope
    of this document includes requirements for the initial issuance and maintenance
    of these credentials, certificate policies as applicable, cryptographic specifications,
    technical specifications for permitted authenticator types, and the command interfaces
    for removable implementations of such PKI-based credentials.
