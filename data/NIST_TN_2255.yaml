abstract:
- content: In this report, we document the models and dimensional traceability of
    our 2.4 mm coaxial airline standards for performing multiline thru-reflect-line
    calibrations up to 50 GHz using vector network analyzers. We identify the equations
    used in our models of the transmission-line standards and present a method for
    determining a coaxial line's metal conductivity using a closed-form solution relating
    it to the propagation constant. Next, we provide details of the traceable dimensional
    measurements and associated uncertainties of our 2.4 mm airline standards. And
    finally, we describe how our software, the NIST Microwave Uncertainty Framework,
    is used to implement physical models of calibration standards and propagate these
    systematic uncertainties to the calibrated scattering-parameters of a device under
    test. We include a measurement example for illustrative purposes.
