abstract:
- content: NoSQL database systems and data stores often outperform traditional RDBMS
    in various aspects, such as data analysis efficiency, system performance, ease
    of deployment, flexibility/scalability of data management, and usersâ€™ availability.
    However, with an increasing number of people storing sensitive data in NoSQL databases,
    security issues have become critical concerns. NoSQL databases suffer from vulnerabilities,
    particularly due to the lack of effective support for data protection, including
    weak authorization mechanisms. As access control is a fundamental data protection
    requirement of any database management system DBMS, this document focuses on access
    control on NoSQL database systems.
