abstract:
- content: 'This report presents local convective boiling heat transfer and Fanning
    friction factor measurements in a micro-fin tube for R134a and two possible low
    global warming potential (GWP) refrigerant replacements for R134a: R1234yf and
    R450A. Test section heating was achieved with water in either counterflow or in
    parallel flow with the test refrigerant to provide for a range of heat fluxes
    for each thermodynamic quality. An existing correlation from the literature for
    single and multi-component mixtures was shown to not satisfactorily predict the
    convective boiling measurements for flow qualities greater than 40 %. Accordingly,
    a new correlation was developed specifically for the test fluids of this study
    so that a fair comparison of the heat transfer performance of the low GWP refrigerants
    to that of R134a could be made. The new correlation was used to compare the heat
    transfer coefficient of the three test fluids at the same heat flux, saturated
    refrigerant temperature, and refrigerant mass flux. The resulting example comparison,
    for the same operating conditions, showed that the heat transfer coefficient of
    the multi-component R450A and the single-component R1234yf were, on average, 15
    % less and 5 % less, respectively, than that of the single-component R134a. Friction
    factor measurements were also compared to predictions from an existing correlation.
    A new correlation for the friction factor was developed to provide a more accurate
    prediction. The measurements and the new models are important for the evaluation
    of potential low-GWP refrigerants replacements for R134a.'
