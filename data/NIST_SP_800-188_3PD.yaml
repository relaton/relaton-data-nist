abstract:
- content: De-identification is a process that is applied to a dataset with the goal
    of preventing or limiting informational risks to individuals, protected groups,
    and establishments while still allowing for meaningful statistical analysis. Government
    agencies can use de-identification to reduce the privacy risk associated with
    collecting, processing, archiving, distributing, or publishing government data.
    Previously, NISTIR 8053, De-Identification of Personal Information, provided a
    survey of de-identification and re-identification techniques. This document provides
    specific guidance to government agencies that wish to use de-identification. Before
    using de-identification, agencies should evaluate their goals for using de-identification
    and the potential risks that de-identification might create. Agencies should decide
    upon a de-identification release model, such as publishing de-identified data,
    publishing synthetic data based on identified data, or providing a query interface
    that incorporates de-identification. Agencies can create a Disclosure Review Board
    to oversee the process of de-identification. They can also adopt a de-identification
    standard with measurable performance levels and perform re-identification studies
    to gauge the risk associated with de-identification. Several specific techniques
    for de-identification are available, including de-identification by removing identifiers
    and transforming quasi-identifiers and the use of formal privacy models. People
    performing de-identification generally use special-purpose software tools to perform
    the data manipulation and calculate the likely risk of re-identification. However,
    not all tools that merely mask personal information provide sufficient functionality
    for performing de-identification. This document also includes an extensive list
    of references, a glossary, and a list of specific de-identification tools, which
    is only included to convey the range of tools currently available and is not intended
    to imply a recommendation or endorsement by NIST.
