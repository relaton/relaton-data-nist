abstract:
- content: This handbook has been prepared as a procedural guide for the compliance
    testing of net content statements on packaged goods. Compliance testing of packaged
    goods is the determination of the conformance results of packaging, distribution,
    and sale of commodities to specific legal requirements for net content declarations.
    This handbook has been developed primarily for the use of state, local, and some
    federal officials. However, it should be useful to commercial and industrial establishments
    areas of packaging, distribution, and sale of commodities. NIST has statutory
    responsibility for "cooperation with states in securing uniformity of weights
    and measures laws and methods of inspection and publishes this and other NIST
    Handbooks in partial fulfillment of this responsibility. This 2023 edition includes
    amendments made though the Committee on Laws and Regulations of the National Conference
    on Weights and Measures (NCWM) with technical guidance from the Office of Weights
    and Measures (OWM) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    and input from weights and measures officials and industry representatives. These
    amendments were adopted by the NCWM at its 107th Annual Meeting in July 2022.
    There may be years where there are no changes to this NIST Handbook 133; therefore,
    it would not be published on an annual basis in such instances. In conducting
    compliance testing, the conversion of measured quantity values between systems
    of measurement (e.g., from the metric system to the U.S. customary system) should
    be handled with careful regard to the implied correspondence between measurement
    accuracy and the number of digits displayed. For all conversions, the number of
    significant figures retained should be congruous with the accuracy of the corresponding
    measurement. For this edition of NIST Handbook 133, all quantity values obtained
    from devices or through test procedures have been rounded to two significant digits
    (e.g., 2.5 cm to 1.0 in), or to a precision level applicable to the test equipment
    (e.g., 200 kPa for 25 psi or 35 MPs for 5000 psi).
