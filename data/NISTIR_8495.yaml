abstract:
- content: In FY 2022, the 22 federal agencies that reported did not add or rescind
    any GUS in lieu of VCS, leaving a total of 80 previously reported GUS in lieu
    of VCS still in use. This analysis does not reflect the use of standards by the
    Department of Defense (DoD) or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) as they report their use of GUS on a categorical basis via a different
    reporting mechanism. Agencies demonstrate the effectiveness of the NTTAA and Circular
    A-119 by their continuous review of opportunities to rescind GUS in favor of using
    VCS, and their involvement with the private sector through the VCS process. These
    activities suggest that federal agencies are cognizant of the benefits of meeting
    their mission needs by actively seeking to use VCS developed by the private sector.
