abstract:
- content: The NIST Outdoor Structure Separation Experiments are part of the NIST
    Structure Separation Experiments project, which is designed to assess structure-to-structure
    fire spread in the wildland-urban interface. In the first phase of this project,
    fire exposures from small source structures (sheds) were quantified in terms of
    mass loss rate and peak heat release rate in the absence of wind. The performance
    of a target structure representing a residential façade was assessed in response
    to exposures from a variety of sheds (differing in construction, size, and fuel
    loading) and separation distances. These experiments were conducted indoors at
    the National Fire Research Laboratory at NIST. The knowledge gained from the indoor
    shed burn experiments was used to develop the outdoor shed burn experiments.This
    report describes a series of outdoor shed burn experiments conducted at NIST to
    study the effects of applied wind on thermal (radiant and convective) exposures
    from variety of sheds to a target structure. The results were used to determine
    the minimum Structure Separation Distance (SSDmin), which is defined as the shortest
    distance between the source (storage shed) and target structure (residence) to
    prevent ignition and flame spread. Experiments were conducted with combustible
    (wood) and noncombustible (steel) sheds, each containing a set of wood cribs and
    ignited to generate typical radiative and convective heat exposures to the target
    structure. The target structure was an assembly including an exterior wall with
    a window and a roof with a vented eave. Effects of shed orientation, shed size,
    SSD, and shed type on thermal exposure to the target structure were studied. The
    thermal exposure was quantified in each case by measuring the peak heat flux and
    temperature at the target structure. Based on target structure performances due
    to thermal exposure from the burning of different source structures, a SSDmin
    was identified. The experiments in this study demonstrated good reproducibility
    of experimental data. The wind had complex effects on the burning behavior of
    wood sheds, affecting flame lengths and convective heat transfer to the target
    structure. For combustible sheds, the peak heat flux measured at the target structure
    corresponded with the total amount of fuel was not affected by orientation (i.e.,
    door opening facing downwind or upwind). In the case of steel sheds with the door
    opening facing the target structure, the applied wind had minimal or no effect
    on thermal exposure to the target structure. The steel sheds contained the fire
    effectively - thus reducing, but not eliminating, the thermal exposure to the
    target structure. For the scenarios evaluated, peak heat flux at the target structure
    could be reduced by half by changing the orientation of the door opening for noncombustible
    sheds. The SSDmin was identified as 10 ft for combustible and noncombustible sheds
    with floor area less than 26 ft2 in scenarios with a fire hardened target structure.
    For sheds with floor area between 26 ft2 and 64 ft², the minimum SSDmin was found
    to be 15 ft. Because the local winds during a WUI fire are unpredictable, SSD
    should be omnidirectional, i.e., the same SSD in all directions. 12 out of the
    13 experiments were conducted with a fire hardened target structure. Experiment
    conducted with a non-fire hardened target structure to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of fire hardening revealed that the non-fire hardened structure ignited within
    6 mins when exposed to a Very Small wood shed with total fuel of 212 kg and SSD
    of 10 ft. With similar thermal exposure, and SSD, the fire hardened target structure
    exhibited minimal thermal damage and significant ignition resistance. Acknowledging
    the limitations of the experimental series, implementation of the minimum separation
    distance identified from the experimental measurements in this study is expected
    to improve community resilience to WUI.
