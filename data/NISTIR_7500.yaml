abstract:
- content: The system of programs described in this paper is concerned with estimating
    the damage ensuing from exposure of specimens in dry and humid atmospheres to
    UV and visible radiation covering the solar range. Damage is monitored quantitatively
    by changes in IR spectra. The dose is estimated from UV spectra of the lamps and
    the interference filters (used to isolate a particular wavelength range). The
    dosage is estimated from the dose and the UV absorption of the specimens themselves.
    These programs allow rapid estimation of dosage and damage from regions of data,
    and manipulation and processing of the massive amounts of data required to carry
    out such comprehensive tests in a complete yet user-friendly manner.
