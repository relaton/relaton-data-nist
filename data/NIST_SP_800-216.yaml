abstract:
- content: Receiving reports on suspected security vulnerabilities in information
    systems is one of the best ways for developers and services to become aware of
    issues. Formalizing actions to accept, assess, and manage vulnerability disclosure
    reports can help reduce known security vulnerabilities. This document recommends
    guidance for establishing a federal vulnerability disclosure framework, properly
    handling vulnerability reports, and communicating the mitigation and/or remediation
    of vulnerabilities. The framework allows for local resolution support while providing
    federal oversight and should be applied to all software, hardware, and digital
    services under federal control.
