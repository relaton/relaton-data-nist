abstract:
- content: The National Online Informative References (OLIR) Program is a NIST effort
    to facilitate subject matter experts in defining standardized Online Informative
    References (OLIRs), which are relationships between elements of documents from
    cybersecurity, privacy, and other information and communications technology domains.
    This document assists OLIR Developers in understanding the processes and requirements
    for participating in the Program. The primary focus of the document is to instruct
    Developers on how to complete an OLIR Template when submitting an OLIR to NIST
    for inclusion in the OLIR Catalog.
