abstract:
- content: This document describes a data structure, referred to as a data block matrix,
    that supports the ongoing addition of hash-linked records while also allowing
    for the deletion of arbitrary records, thereby preserving hash-based integrity
    assurance that other blocks are unchanged. The block matrix data structure may
    have utility for incorporation into applications requiring integrity protection
    that currently use permissioned blockchains. This capability could for example
    be useful in meeting privacy requirements such as the European Union General Data
    Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires that organizations make it possible
    to delete all information related to a particular individual, at that personâ€™s
    request.
