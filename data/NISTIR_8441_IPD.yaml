abstract:
- content: The space sector is transitioning away from traditional vertically-integrated
    entities and towards Hybrid Satellite Networks (HSN) which is an aggregation of
    independently owned and operated terminals, antennas, satellites, payloads, or
    other components that comprise a satellite system. The elements of an HSN may
    have varying levels of assurance. HSNs may interact with government systems and
    critical infrastructure (as defined by the Department of Homeland Security). A
    framework is required to assess the security posture of the individual components
    while still enabling the HSN to provide its function. This report applies the
    NIST Cybersecurity Framework to HSNs with an emphasis on the interfaces between
    the participants of the HSN. In collaboration with subject matter experts including
    satellite builders, consultants, acquisition authorities, operators (commercial
    and government), academia, and other interested parties, the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed the HSN Cybersecurity Framework
    CSF Profile (HSN Profile) to guide space stakeholders. The resulting profile provides
    a starting point for stakeholders who are assessing the cybersecurity posture
    of their HSN.
