abstract:
- content: In December 2019, NIST Interagency Report 8280 quantified and visualized
    demographic variations for many face recognition algorithms. The report also suggested
    various mitigations, one of which - the focus of this report - was to define summary
    inequity measures that developers can work to improve and which can guide algorithm
    selection. Since 2019, it has become apparent that false negative inequities are
    substantially due to poor photography of certain groups including under-exposure
    of dark-skinned individuals, and that this can be addressed by using algorithms
    more tolerant of poor image quality or, better, by correcting the capture process
    with superior cameras, imaging environments and humanfactors. At the same time,
    it is also clear that the much larger false positive variations, which occur even
    in high-quality photographs, must be mitigated by algorithm developers. To those
    ends, this report compiles and analyzes various demographic summary measures for
    how face recognition false positive and false negative error rates differ across
    age, sex, and race-based demographic groups. We exercise some of the proposed
    measures by tabulating them for many algorithms submitted to the one-to-one comparison
    track of the Face Recognition Vendor Test. Those results appear on a regularly
    updated public webpage.
