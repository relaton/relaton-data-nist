abstract:
- content: Medical imaging devices and systems must be calibrated to ensure uniformity
    and reliability of test results. A standard reference material (SRM) or "phantom",
    as it is known in the medical imaging community, is used to replicate fundamental
    characteristics of tissue and/or the material for which the imaging device is
    intended for use. SRMs can be readily deployed to sites where devices are being
    used, negating the need to physically relocate instruments for calibration or
    performance testing. The SRM produced in this work is appropriate for calibrating
    depth-resolving 3D optical systems such as optical coherent tomography (OCT).
    The SRM consists of three layers of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films on a gridded
    glass slide. A thin, clear layer of PDMS is sandwiched between two thicker scattering
    layers of PDMS. The scattering layers contain titanium dioxide (TiO2) as scattering
    particles to allow easy identification of the thicknesses of the three layers
    as a dimensional calibration of the axial resolution of an optical coherence tomographic
    imaging device. The concentration of TiO2 scattering particles in PDMS can be
    adjusted to control its scattering coefficient to mimic that of biological tissue
    which was independently measured by a broadband integrating sphere system at NIST
    for these concentrations. The thickness of each layer was measured by NIST's spectral
    domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) instrument to produce data similar
    to that obtained using clinical devices. The axial dimensions of each region of
    interest of the SRM was determined from the pixelated, 3D tomographs acquired
    with an index of refraction (n) = 1, then converted from pixels to µm using a
    NIST-traceable height standard to calibrate the NIST SD-OCT and then corrected
    by the index of refraction of PDMS as measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry at
    the appropriate OCT wavelength. For the users of the SRMs, we have developed an
    algorithm which can be applied to a 3D tomograph obtained from any OCT to detect
    the interfacial planes between the three layers of the SRM. The algorithm reports
    the local layer thicknesses for each pixel across the entire lateral dimension
    of the tomographic data cube. The user can then compare the output of the algorithm
    generated by their OCT tomograph to the values from NIST to determine the calibration
    of their instrument. For each SRM, we report a mean thickness and standard deviation
    for each of the three-layer thicknesses across 9 regions of interest as defined
    by a target grid registered in the SRM.
