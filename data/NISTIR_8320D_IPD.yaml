abstract:
- content: Organizations employ a growing volume of machine identities, often numbering
    in the thousands or millions per organization. Machine identities, such as secret
    cryptographic keys, can be used to identify which policies need to be enforced
    for each machine. Centralized management of machine identities helps streamline
    policy implementation across devices, workloads, and environments. However, the
    lack of protection for sensitive data in use (e.g., machine identities in memory)
    puts it at risk. This report presents an effective approach for overcoming security
    challenges associated with creating, managing, and protecting machine identities
    throughout their lifecycle. It describes a proof-of-concept implementation, a
    prototype, that addresses those challenges by using hardware-based confidential
    computing. The report is intended to be a blueprint or template that the general
    security community can use to validate and utilize the described implementation.
