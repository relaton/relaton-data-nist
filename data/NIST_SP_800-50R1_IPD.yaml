abstract:
- content: This publication provides guidance for federal agencies and organizations
    to develop and manage a lifecycle approach to building a cybersecurity and privacy
    learning program (hereafter referred to as CPLP). The approach is intended to
    address the needs of large and small organizations as well as those building an
    entirely new program. The information leverages broadly accepted standards, regulations,
    legislation, and best practices. The recommendations are customizable and may
    be implemented as part of an organization-wide process that manages awareness,
    training, and education programs for a diverse set of employee audiences. The
    guidance also includes suggested metrics and evaluation methods in order that
    the program be regularly improved and updated as needs will evolve.
