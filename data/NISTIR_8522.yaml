abstract:
- content: A workshop in methane super emitter and consensus standards was held in
    January 2024. This workshop brought together measurement teams, regulators, and
    a wide range of federal agencies. The use of remote sensing measurement systems
    on drones, aircraft, and satellites to detect large methane emissions from oil
    and gas, landfills, and manure management is expanding rapidly. To increase the
    utility and trust in this data, consensus on the terminology and best practices
    needs to be developed and documented.
