abstract:
- content: Lifeline infrastructure systems provide services to support communities,
    including life safety, public health, and social-economic factors. They require
    both built assets and the human agency necessary to operate them, but there are
    no known frameworks that integrate both the assets and the organizational actions
    needed to go along with the design assumptions to meet target recovery objectives.
    This document presents an initial framework that guides the reader through steps
    to achieve system-level functional recovery of lifeline infrastructure systems
    after earthquake events by addressing how to provide the services that users need
    when they need them by considering design of lifeline infrastructure system components,
    development of organizational policy and strategies, and evaluation of system
    capacity. The framework is useful for the design of individual components as the
    need arises or as a guide for conducting a wholesale assessment for retrofit upgrade,
    maintenance, extensions, or replacements. Likewise, the framework is useful for
    developing policies and strategies to ensure that organizations are adequately
    prepared or to guide the wholesale assessment of all groups in planning organizational
    improvements. The framework considers dependencies and interdependencies of water,
    wastewater, and electric power systems and is applicable to other lifeline infrastructure
    systems. It is flexible and can be applied at full or partial system scales so
    that services can be restored after earthquakes within a targeted recovery time.The
    development of this framework was based on consideration of only water, wastewater,
    and electric power systems, and the application to these three systems is illustrated
    in Volume 2. However, the general framework presented is intended to apply to
    all lifeline infrastructure systems. The primary audience for the framework includes
    owner representatives who manage and operate lifeline infrastructure systems and
    analysts and designers working in support. Example applications of the framework
    to hypothetical water, wastewater, and electric power infrastructure systems are
    presented in Volume 2 to benefit analysts and designers of lifeline infrastructure
    systems.
