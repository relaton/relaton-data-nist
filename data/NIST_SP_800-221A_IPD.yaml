abstract:
- content: The increasing frequency, creativity, and severity of technology attacks
    means that all enterprises should ensure that information and communication technology
    (ICT) risk is receiving appropriate attention within their enterprise risk management
    (ERM) programs. Specific types of ICT risk include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity,
    privacy, supply chain, and artificial intelligence risk. This document provides
    a framework of outcomes that applies to all types of ICT risk. It complements
    NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-221, Enterprise Impact of Information and Communication
    Technology Risk, which focuses on the use of risk registers to communicate and
    manage ICT risk.
