abstract:
- content: Genomic data has enabled the rapid growth of the U.S. bioeconomy and is
    valuable to the individual, industry, and government because it has multiple intrinsic
    properties that in combination make it different from other types of high value
    data which possess only a subset of these properties. The characteristics of genomic
    data compared to other high value datasets raises some correspondingly unique
    cybersecurity and privacy challenges that are inadequately addressed with current
    policies, guidance documents, and technical controls. This report describes current
    practices in risk management, cybersecurity, and privacy management for protecting
    genomic data along with relevant challenges and concerns. Gaps in protection practices
    across the lifecycle were identified concerning genomic data generation, safe
    and responsible sharing of the genomic data, monitoring the systems processing
    genomic data, lack of specific guidance documents addressing the unique needs
    of genomic data processors, and regulatory/policy gaps with respect to national
    security and privacy threats in the collection, storage, sharing, and aggregation
    of human genomic data. The report proposes a set of solution ideas that address
    real-life use cases occurring at various stages of the genomic data lifecycle
    along with candidate mitigation strategies and the expected benefits of the solutions.
    Additionally, areas needing regulatory/policy enactment or further research are
    highlighted.
