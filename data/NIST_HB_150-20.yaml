abstract:
- content: 'NIST Handbook 150-20 represents the technical requirements and guidance
    for the accreditation of laboratories under the National Voluntary Laboratory
    Accreditation Program (NVLAP) Information Technology Security Testing: Common
    Criteria Testing. It is intended for information and use by accredited laboratories,
    laboratories seeking accreditation, laboratory accreditation systems, users of
    laboratory services, and others needing information on the requirements for accreditation
    under this program. The 2014 edition of NIST Handbook 150-20 supersedes and replaces
    the 2005 edition. The handbook was revised with the participation of technical
    experts in applicable fields of testing concerning information technology security
    and the Common Criteria, and was approved by NVLAP. The following main changes
    have been made to this handbook with respect to the previous edition: - all references
    to applicable guides and standards have been updated; - the sequence of NVLAP
    assessment activities and the proficiency testing program have been changed; -
    all requirements have been updated to reflect the relevant changes within the
    National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP); and - the number of annexes
    has been reduced from four to two. Annexes A and B show the sequence of events
    and the responsible parties for initial accreditation and development of written
    procedures. This handbook is also available on the NVLAP website (http://www.nist.gov/nvlap)'
