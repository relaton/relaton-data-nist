abstract:
- content: The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is of paramount
    importance to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability of the Federal
    Government to successfully conduct its essential missions and functions. This
    publication provides federal agencies with recommended security requirements for
    protecting the confidentiality of CUI when the information is resident in nonfederal
    systems and organizations. The requirements apply to components of nonfederal
    systems that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such
    components. The security requirements are intended for use by federal agencies
    in contractual vehicles or other agreements established between those agencies
    and nonfederal organizations. This publication can be used in conjunction with
    its companion publication, NIST Special Publication 800-171A, which provides a
    comprehensive set of procedures to assess the security requirements.
