abstract:
- content: This document describes a calibration service to measure the water diffusion
    coefficient, or diffusivity, in reference materials and tissue mimics using nuclear
    magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. This calibration is restricted to materials
    which exhibit isotropic Gaussian water diffusion. The measurement uses the water
    proton spin as a tag and standard NMR gradient techniques to measure diffusion
    of the proton magnetization, which, in low viscosity fluids, is largely determined
    by the physical diffusion of water molecules. The calibrated materials are meant
    to be used in phantoms (calibration devices) to verify the accuracy of magnetic
    resonance imaging (MRI)-based water diffusion measurements. The local diffusion
    coefficient (often referred to as the apparent diffusion coefficient in complex
    materials) and other associated parameters, are used as image-based biomarkers
    to assess the state of tissue cellular density, detect tissue anomalies, characterize
    tumor type, evaluate treatment efficacy, and assess neural connectivity and neural
    tissue degeneration. A biomarker, as defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
    is a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator
    of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or biological responses
    to a therapeutic intervention. [1] Diffusion coefficients, which describe the
    rate that water protons move due to random thermal motion, are phenomenological
    parameters that must be carefully defined and measured to enable rigorous quantification
    and their use as biomarkers for clinical decision making. Diffusion parameters,
    in addition to being dependent on local material properties, are dependent on
    environmental parameters such as temperature, which must be controlled and precisely
    and accurately measured.
