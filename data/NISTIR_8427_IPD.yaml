abstract:
- content: NIST SP 800-90 series support the generation of high-quality random bits
    for cryptographic and non-cryptographic use. The security of a random number generator
    depends on the unpredictability of its outputs, which can be measured in terms
    of entropy. NIST SP 800-90 series uses min-entropy to measure entropy. A full-entropy
    bitstring has an amount of entropy equal to its length. Full-entropy bitstrings
    are important for cryptographic applications, as these bitstrings have ideal randomness
    properties and may be used for any cryptographic purpose. Due to the difficulty
    of generating and testing full-entropy bitstrings, SP 800-90 series assume that
    a bitstring has full entropy if the amount of entropy per bit is at least 1 -
    ε, where ε is at most 2-32. This report provides a justification for the selection
    of ε. This is accomplished as follows. The report begins by defining full entropy
    in terms of a hypothetical distinguishing game. The report then derives two results
    following from this definition. First, it is shown how output satisfying this
    definition can be generated using a conditioning function acting on data having
    a known entropy level. Second, the actual entropy level of output produced by
    such a process is computed, thereby providing support for the selected value of
    ε.
