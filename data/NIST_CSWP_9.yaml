abstract:
- content: 'Identity management systems (IDMSs) are widely used to provision user
    identities while managing authentication, authorization, and data sharing within
    organizations and on the web. Traditional identity systems typically suffer from
    single points of failure, lack of interoperability, and privacy issues, such as
    enabling mass data collection and user tracking. Blockchain technology has the
    potential to alleviate these concerns: it can support the ability for users to
    control the custody of their own identifiers and credentials, enabling novel data
    ownership and governance models with built-in control and consent mechanisms.
    Hence, blockchain-based IDMSs, which could benefit both users and businesses,
    are beginning to proliferate. This work categorizes these systems into a taxonomy
    based on differences in blockchain architectures, governance models, and other
    salient features. Context is provided for the taxonomy through the description
    of related terms, emerging standards, and use cases while highlighting relevant
    security and privacy considerations.'
