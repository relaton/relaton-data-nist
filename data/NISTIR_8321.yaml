abstract:
- content: This is a report for Inter-agency agreement 693KA9-18-N-00023 "Maximum
    Luminous Intensity for LED Signaling in an Airport Environment" by Federal Aviation
    Administration (FAA) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
    The LED-based lighted X signs recently introduced at many airports are perceived
    too bright by pilots, causing glare and making it difficult to recognize the X
    character. The objective of the study is to determine the acceptable level of
    maximum luminous intensity of LED-lighted X signs that maintains clear visibility
    of the lighted X sign. A theoretical study with literature review was first made
    (Part 1). Then vision experiments were conducted using pilots as subjects (Part
    2). The methods and results of these studies are reported.
