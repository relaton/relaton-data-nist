abstract:
- content: This report focuses on the NIST-recommended block cipher modes of operation
    specified in NIST Special Publications (SP) 800-38A through 800-38F. The goal
    is to provide a concise survey of relevant research results about the algorithms
    and their implementations. Based on these findings, the report concludes with
    a set of recommendations to improve the corresponding standards.
