abstract:
- content: The NIST Charpy Machine Verification Program is ready to introduce low-energy
    and high-energy certified specimens that can be tested at room temperature instead
    of -40 °C, thus accommodating the requests of many customers during the past 35
    years. An investigation aimed at providing a practical and technically sound definition
    of "room temperature" (barycentric value and tolerance) was conducted, by examining
    previously obtained Charpy energy transition curves for different energy levels,
    as well as by testing certified low-energy and high-energy specimens at 21 °C
    (ambient temperature of the NIST Charpy Lab in Boulder, Colorado) and additional
    temperatures in the range 21 °C ± 5 °C. Results have shown that for low-energy
    specimens, even within a relatively small 10 °C range, the influence of test temperature
    on Charpy absorbed energy can be significant enough to cause "good" machines to
    fail the requirements of the ASTM E23 standard. Therefore, at this energy level,
    the allowable test temperature range must be restricted to 21 °C ± 1 °C. For the
    other two energy levels (high and super-high), the influence of test temperature
    is small enough that the allowable temperature range can be expanded to 21 °C
    ± 3 °C.
