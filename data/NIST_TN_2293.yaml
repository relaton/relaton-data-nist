abstract:
- content: This NIST Technical Note presents a User’s Manual of the DAD_PBD software
    for mid- and high-rise steel structures. A Database-Assisted Design (DAD) method
    for the design of tall buildings that utilizes time-varying aerodynamic pressure
    data from wind tunnel measurements or numerical simulations and wind climate data
    of the target site has been developed at NIST and has proven effective in the
    past. As opposed to the analytical method, the DAD approach allows for time-domain
    and wind directional analyses that could provide the full phase details with higher
    mode shapes and for a site-specific Performance-Based Design (PBD). However, the
    approach lacked practicability to structural engineers due to reliance on in-house
    analysis software intended for research purposes. DAD_BPD software is developed
    and presented herein, a powerful and user-friendly tool that enables the DAD method
    to be more accessible to structural engineers by integrating a widely used commercial
    structural analysis and design software, ETABS. In the past year, MATLAB-based
    software was first developed but, as recommended by industry partners, now has
    migrated to Python-based software to increase accessibility to practicing engineers
    and to improve computational time. The structural and dynamic analyses are performed
    by ETABS, and the analysis and design of steel members are carried out in Python.
    DAD_PBD ultimately provides design response curves as a function of mean recurrence
    intervals (MRIs) of various design parameters, including Demand-to-Capacity Index
    (DCI), inter-story drift ratio, floor acceleration, and Deformation Damage Index
    (DDI). The design is iterated until the design responses satisfy the design specification.
    The User’s Manual includes an example of the application of the software.
