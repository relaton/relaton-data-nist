abstract:
- content: NISTmAb RM 8671 is an IgG1? monoclonal antibody that has been extensively
    characterized and released as the first of its kind biopharmaceutical reference
    material in 2016. This material was intended primarily for use in evaluating the
    performance of methods for determining physicochemical and biophysical attributes
    of monoclonal antibodies. It also provides a representative test molecule for
    development of novel technologies for therapeutic protein characterization. The
    lifecycle management of NISTmAb includes a long-term stability verification to
    evaluate the homogeneity and stability for the first 3 lots (14HB-D 001, 14HB-D-002,
    and 14HB-D-003) of this material. Initial certification to assign property values
    and confirm identification used a wide variety of analytical methods including
    UV Vis spectrophotometry, size exclusion chromatography, capillary electrophoresis,
    dynamic light scattering, flow imaging, and peptide mapping. Reported here is
    a summary of these analytical methods and results for the 5-year stability verification
    (5YSV) for RM 8671 demonstrating the material is homogeneous and stable.
