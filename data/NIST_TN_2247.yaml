abstract:
- content: This report summarizes the design and description for an automated system
    of velocity traverse probes. Performance of key components of the system are also
    described. The system is designed for conducting detailed characterizations of
    flow distributions in exhaust ducts and smokestacks. Accurate flow measurements
    in large exhaust systems for flue gases are critical for quantifying greenhouse
    gas and pollutant emissions due to fossil fuel combustion. Field deployment of
    the system has been demonstrated. It will be utilized to conduct in-line calibrations
    of the flow monitoring devices installed at the exhaust ducts of the National
    Fire Research Laboratory. The system is a prototype for future designs which can
    be applied to characterize flow conditions for similarly-sized exhaust ducts and
    smokestacks. Other potential uses of the system are for precise positioning of
    probes and instruments in and around adverse environments such as enclosure fires
    or open burns.
