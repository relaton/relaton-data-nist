abstract:
- content: The NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-90 series supports the generation
    of high-quality random bits for cryptographic and non-cryptographic use. The security
    strength of a random number generator depends on the unpredictability of its outputs.
    This unpredictability can be measured in terms of entropy, which the NIST SP 800-90
    series measures using min-entropy. A full-entropy bitstring has an amount of entropy
    equal to its length. Full-entropy bitstrings are important for cryptographic applications,
    as these bitstrings have ideal randomness properties and may be used for any cryptographic
    purpose.
