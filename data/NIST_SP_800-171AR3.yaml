abstract:
- content: The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is of paramount
    importance to federal agencies and can directly impact the ability of the Federal
    Government to successfully conduct its essential missions and functions. This
    publication provides organizations with assessment procedures and a methodology
    that can be used to conduct assessments of the security requirements in NIST Special
    Publication 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal
    Systems and Organizations. The assessment procedures are flexible and can be customized
    to the needs of organizations and assessors. Assessments can be conducted as independent,
    third-party assessments or as government-sponsored assessments. The assessments
    can be applied with various degrees of rigor based on customer-defined depth and
    coverage attributes.
