abstract:
- content: The objective of state machine replication (SMR) is to emulate a centralized
    service in a distributed, fault-tolerant fashion. To this end, a set of mutually
    distrusting processes must agree on the execution of client-submitted commands.
    Since the advent of Bitcoin, the idea of SMR has received significant attention.
    This document surveys both classical and more modern research on SMR and details
    many of the most significant permissioned and permissionless algorithms, their
    performance, and security considerations.
