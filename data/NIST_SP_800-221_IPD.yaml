abstract:
- content: All enterprises should ensure that information and communications technology
    (ICT) risk receives appropriate attention within their enterprise risk management
    (ERM) programs. This document is intended to help individual organizations within
    an enterprise improve their ICT risk management (ICTRM). This can enable enterprises
    and their component organizations to better identify, assess, and manage their
    ICT risks in the context of their broader mission and business objectives. This
    document explains the value of rolling up and integrating risks that may be addressed
    at lower system and organizational levels to the broader enterprise level by focusing
    on the use of ICT risk registers as input to the enterprise risk profile.
