abstract:
- content: A wireless sensor network was created to measure water-flow rate in a fire
    hose. An integrated electronic piezoelectric (IEPE) accelerometer was chosen as
    the sensor to measure the flow rate based on the vibrations generated by water
    flowing through a fire hose. The improved flow apparatus, including the accelerometer,
    was lightweight, small, and easily attached and removed to any location along
    the fire hose, not obstructing the water s flow path. The wireless flow apparatus
    was used with realistic firefighting hose conditions (i.e., holding the hose nozzle,
    nozzle motion during simulated fire suppression, simulated hose dragging) to evaluate
    the upgraded apparatus function and determine the influence of the hose motion,
    accelerometer location, and nozzle spray on the dominant-frequency metric. While
    more research is needed, such as enhancing the robustness of the dominant frequency
    metric, the preliminary research and this update shows the potential of a smart
    fire hose for improved situational awareness during fire suppression.
