abstract:
- content: Urinary excretion of albumin is a major diagnostic and prognostic marker
    of kidney disease; therefore, accurate measurement of urine albumin is essential
    to clinical diagnosis. To support the accuracy and comparability of clinical urine
    albumin measurements, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    has partnered with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
    Diseases (NIDDK) Laboratory Working Group (LWG) and the International Federation
    of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) Working Group for the Standardization of Albumin
    Assays in Urine (WG-SAU) to develop a reference measurement system for urine albumin.
    NIST has developed the foundational components of the reference measurement system
    for urine albumin, a series of higher-order reference materials and a reference
    measurement procedure (RMP), to establish a traceability scheme that will link
    clinical urine albumin to the International System of Units (SI). The NIST RMP
    for urine albumin is based on the detection and quantification of signature proteotypic
    (trypsin) albumin peptides via isotope dilution-liquid chromatography-tandem mass
    spectrometry (ID-LCMS/MS) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The RMP incorporates
    an isotopically labeled (15N) full-length recombinant human serum albumin (15N-rHSA)
    material as the internal standard, which permits the absolute quantification of
    albumin in urine. Out of the 11 tryptic peptides selected to monitor the albumin
    in urine, 5 albumin peptides were used for the absolute quantification of albumin
    in urine. This publication outlines the NIST RMP for the absolute quantification
    of albumin in urine by ID-LC-MS/MS.
